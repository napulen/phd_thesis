I was extracting useful references from the "Counterpoint by Convolution" (COCONET) paper.

I ended up with a compilation of 10 papers that I could investigate further. Most of the papers deal with Bach chorales. This is the best initial approach for me as well.

I went to give a brief look at the Bach chorales annotated by Craig Sapp on the Verovio Humdrum Viewer. I realized the quality of these files is very high. Craig annotated harmonies that coincided with cadences in a very systematic way. The rest of the notation is very close to `**harm` syntax. My `harmalysis` parser should be able to deal with this information with ease.

I noticed that the annotations often ignore passing tones and non-functional harmonies. Using this information to reduce the vocabulary of classes in the training process is a must. I can try both approaches, raw pitch-class sets (no annotation needed) and annotated. This will, for once, tell us if expert-curated data improves machine learning models.

I haven't revised the other papers collected from COCONET. I should start with Allan and Williams (2005), they used chord vocabularies.
