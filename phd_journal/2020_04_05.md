## On the relationship between modulation and roman numerals

At Friday, Ich and I had a discussion that went in a different direction that I wished.Â 

I proposed roman numerals as the core of my dissertation. Roman numerals as an application, as a feature, as task. Roman numerals are helpful for **materializing a** modulation analysis, dataset, and evaluation.

Ich did not like the idea very much. He suggested the title of my thesis could be _"What is a modulation?"_. Although it sounds very academic, I think it is too broad and risky.

As I am annotating the Rimsky-Korsakov examples, I realize why roman numeral are so useful to me. Roman numerals are the **language** of modulation analysis. Through roman numerals, I can explain whether a sequence of chords is a modulation or not. Through roman numerals, tonicizations become clear and well-explained. Actually not very well-explained, but it is the best we got.

I think Roman Numeral Analysis is the language of key analysis. Additionally, it simultaneosly provides guidance in other aspects of music analysis. Among them: chords, bass, spelling, and even structure (Cad64 a good example).

I perform my modulation analysis **through** roman numeral analysis annotations.
