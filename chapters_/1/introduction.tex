The main objective of this dissertation is to propose
improvements over the existing methods for automatic tonal
analysis, tailored around the \emph{common-practice} period
of Western music.

In recent years, improvement has been observed using
multitask learning (MTL) workflows for tonal analysis. This
research extends over that, proposing additional ways of
doing data augmentation, and strengthening the shared
representations of MTL approaches with additional tonal
tasks, and proposing alternative neural network
architectures.
