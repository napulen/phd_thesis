The chord predictions in the \gls{pcset121} classification
task always provide a valid chord to reconstruct the Roman
numeral. This is not the case for the
\gls{bass35}-\gls{tenor35}-\gls{alto35}-\gls{soprano35} and
\gls{rn31}-\gls{tonicization35} tasks, which may provide
chord interpretations that do not exist in the vocabulary.
However, the predictions from the \gls{pcset121} may be
incorrect for a chord where the other combinations are
correct. In this experiment, the accuracy of Roman numeral
reconstruction is assessed for this classification task.
