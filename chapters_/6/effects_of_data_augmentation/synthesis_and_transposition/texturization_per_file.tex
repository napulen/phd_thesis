The block-chord realizations of the annotations can be
texturized with the techniques discussed in
\refsubsubsec{texturizationpatterns}. Each time a
synthesized example is generated, the texturization patterns
are applied to the generated score to enrich the texture of
the synthesized examples. The current experiment assesses
the effect of this texturization process in the performance
of the model.
