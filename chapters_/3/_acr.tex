Automatic Chord Recognition (ACR) has been explored
thoroughly in the field of Music Information Retrieval
(MIR). ACR systems typically seek to predict the root and
quality of the chords throughout a piece of music via either
an audio or a symbolic representation. A more specific type
of chordal analysis, particularly relevant for Western
classical music, is functional harmony, or Roman numeral
analysis. The main difference between ACR and functional
harmony is that the latter requires other adjacent tasks to
be solved simultaneously, notably including detection and
identification of key changes (modulations
\parencite{feisthauer2020estimating, schreiber2020local} and
tonicizations \parencite{napoleslopez2020local}).

Partly due to the repertoires typically targeted, Roman
numeral analysis also involves handling of some additional
`special chords' such as Neapolitan and Augmented sixth
chords.

For a summary of general ACR strategies, see Pauwels et al.
\parencite{pauwels201920}.
