Symbolic,2004,Yoshino and Abe,,,,
Symbolic,2005,Bellmann,Bellmann-Budge,Chord frequency,"Bellmann used the chord frequencies collected by Helen Budge in her PhD dissertation (1936) to create a new scale degree probability distribution. This probability distribution is used to compute the most likely key of a fragment of a score (typically, a measure long) by computing the dot product between the notes found in the excerpt and the scale degree distribution.",

Symbolic,2015,White,,Probabilistic, Learns a tonal vocabulary and syntax by grouping together chords that share scale degrees and occur in the same contexts and compiling a transition matrix between these chord groups. This training was then used by an anal? ysis algorithm to determine the key and chords of an unanalyzed piece of music,No evaluation
