I will first and foremost thank my PhD advisor, Ichiro
Fujinaga. For the most part of my PhD, Ichiro scheduled
weekly meetings with me that were of the utmost help.
Together, we walked through machine-learning prototypes,
presentations, code, music theories, and papers. Ichiro and
Masako also made me feel supported since I set foot in
Montr\'eal,\footnote{To be precise, since I set foot in
Canada for the first time in my life, at the Trudeau airport
in Montreal.} making it a pleasant experience for me and my
partner to live and work in the city all these years. Thank
you.

Secondly, I would like to thank my family, who have
supported me all along: my spouse and best friend, Kinga; my
parents, Martha and Eduardo; my siblings, Grecia, Eric, and
sister-in-law Fabiola; and my parents in law, Gra\.zyna and
Miros\l{}aw.

After my advisor, my co-authors provided me with many ideas
and feedback related to the research presented here. Thanks
to all of you: Gabriel Vigliensoni, Claire Arthur, Laurent
Feisthauer, Florence Lev\'e, Mark Gotham, and the
Computational Tonal Studies group.

Thanks to all the members of the \gls{ddmal} and
\gls{cirmmt} communities, but particularly, thanks to
Gabriel Vigliensoni, Martha Thomae, Matan Gover, Yulia
Draginda, Yuval Adler, Alex Daigle, Emily Hopkins, Yaolong
Ju, Timothy de Reuse, Sylvain Margot, Jacob Sanz-Robinson,
and K\'e Zhang.

Thanks to McGill professors Julie Cumming, Peter Schubert,
William Caplin, Jon Wild, Philippe Depalle, Marcelo
Wanderley, Gary Scavone, and Stephen McAdams from whom I
learned different aspects of music and technology that
contributed explicitly or implicitly to the work presented
in this dissertation.

Thanks to other members of the global music information
retrieval and computational musicology communities,
particularly, Craig Sapp, Helena Cuesta, Michael Scott
Cuthbert, Jinny Park, Jacob Tyler Walls, Emilia
Parada-Cabaleiro, Reinier de Valk, Rebecca Salganik, and
others with whom I shared code, papers, and friendship.

The research presented in this dissertation would not have
been possible without the generous support of different
institutions. The \gls{frqsc}, from which I obtained a
doctoral scholarship from 2019--2022 (dossier number
271479); \gls{cirmmt}, from which I obtained several travel
awards and a student project award; the \gls{simssa}
project, from which I received a generous stipend during the
first two years of my PhD (2017--2018) and a role as a
casual research assistant for the remainder of my PhD; the
Schulich School of Music, from which I received additional
travel and conference registration awards; the Digital
Research Alliance of Canada, which facilitated computing
resources for running experiments; and Mitacs, which funded
part of an internship project at Avid Technology. Thank you
to all of these wonderful organizations and their commitment
to music research.

Thanks to people who had an early influence in me and helped
me to set my current path: Luis Alberto Casillas
Santill\'an, Abelardo Guti\'errez, Juan Jos\'e L\'opez
Sandoval, Nancy Arana Daniel, Sergio Bola\~nos, Leo Hendrik
Reyes, and Juan Rodrigo P\'erez C\'ardenas.

Lastly, my friends, for always being there: Jhonnatan Razo,
Dulce Alcal\'a, and El\'i Lezama. Â¡Gracias, amigos!
