\paragraph{Chapter 1}
All contributions in this chapter are by
me.\footnote{N\'estor N\'apoles L\'opez.}

\paragraph{Chapter 2}
All contributions in this chapter are by me. However, I
benefitted from a fruitful discussion in
\emph{SMTDiscuss},\footnotelink{https://discuss.societymusictheory.org/discussion/553/history-of-roman-numeral-analysis}
which lead to new references and ideas. Particularly, thanks
to Nicolas Mee\`us and Phil Duker for participating in this
conversation.

\paragraph{Chapter 3} 
\refsubsec{keyestimation} takes several ideas and findings
from a published conference paper
\parencite{napoleslopez2020local}. Particularly, the reviews
of \gls{gke} and \gls{lke} models was conducted by Laurent
Feisthauer and myself, in equal contribution. The review of
\gls{gke} had minor contributions by Florence Lev\'e.

\paragraph{Chapter 4} 
During the course of this research, Mark Gotham and myself,
independently (and in collaboration, during the writing of a
co-authored conference paper:
\cite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet}) contributed
conversions, revisions, and corrections to the listed Roman
numeral analysis datasets. Workflows for data ``hygiene''
and correcting mistranscriptions were also independently
developed by both. The data-curation workflows described in
\refsec{generalpreparationofthedata}, however, are the ones
I developed myself. The data-augmentation technique
introduced in
\refsubsec{synthesisofartificialtrainingexamples}, is a
contribution of mine. However, co-author Mark Gotham first
proposed the idea of artificial texturization for this
approach. The patterns chosen for texturization and the
software implementation of those patterns were contributed
by me.

\paragraph{Chapter 5}
This chapter is based on (and extends) a peer-reviewed
conference paper \parencite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet}.
The proposed neural network architecture is my contribution.

\paragraph{Chapter 6}
All the experiments reported in this chapter were conducted
by me. Likewise for all tables and comparisons.

\paragraph{Chapter 7}
All contributions in this chapter are by me.
