This \thesisdiss{} is a multidisciplinary research effort at
the intersection of music theory and computer science.

\paragraph{Chapter 2}

This chapter contributes a historical review of \gls{rna}
notations throughout multiple harmony books. This is a
contribution to the existing knowledge of this subject
because some of these relationships have not been explored
before. For example, the adoption of a certain \gls{rna}
symbol to denote a specific musical chord.

\paragraph{Chapter 3}

This chapter contributes a survey of \gls{mir} approaches
for for \gls{arna}, \gls{gke}, \gls{lke}, and pitch
spelling. 

\paragraph{Chapter 4}

This chapter describes the, to the best of my knowledge,
largest publicly available dataset of \gls{rna} annotations,
as well as a short survey of its underlying collections. It
also contributes the description of a new data-augmentation
technique proposed in this dissertation.

\paragraph{Chapter 5}

This chapter describes the main \gls{arna} machine learning
model contributed by this dissertation.

\paragraph{Chapter 6}

This chapter contributes the experimental evaluation of the
machine learning model proposed in the dissertation.
