\label{chap:contributionstoknowledge}

This \thesisdiss{} is a multidisciplinary research effort at
the intersection of music theory and computer science.

\refchap{introductiontoromannumeralanalysis} includes a
historical review of \gls{rna} notations throughout multiple
harmony books. This is a contribution to the existing
knowledge of this subject because some of these
relationships have not been explored before. For example,
the first time an author adopted a certain symbol to denote
a specific musical chord. 

\refchap{modeldesign} describes an original neural network
architecture to output \glspl{rna} labels. This chapter also
discusses new methods for data augmentation, which leverage
the existing datasets of expert-curated harmonic analyses.
