This \thesisdiss{} is a multidisciplinary research effort at
the intersection of music theory and computer science.

\paragraph{Chapter 2}

This chapter contributes a historical review of \gls{rna}
notations throughout multiple harmony books. This is a
contribution to the existing knowledge of this subject
because some of these relationships have not been explored
before. For example, the adoption of a certain \gls{rna}
symbol to denote a specific musical chord.

\refchap{modeldesign} describes an original neural network
architecture to output \glspl{rna} labels. This chapter also
discusses new methods for data augmentation, which leverage
the existing datasets of expert-curated harmonic analyses.
