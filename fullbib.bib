The author’s ps13 algorithm and the pitch spelling algorithms of Cambouropoulos, Temperley and Longuet-Higgins were run on a corpus of tonal music containing 1.73 million notes. ps13 spelt significantly more of the notes in this corpus correctly than the other algorithms (99.33\% correct). However, Temperley’s algorithm spelt significantly more intervals between consecutive notes correctly than the other algorithms (99.45\% correct). All the algorithms performed less well on classical music than baroque music. However, ps13 performed more consistently across the various composers and styles than the other algorithms.},

A model of key finding is presented for single-voiced pieces of tonal music. Each tone is input as a pitch class and a duration. The model makes a parallel search for the key in the scalar and chordal domains, taking into account primacy and memory constraints. The model has been tested for a range of tonal music including the fugue subjects of J. S. Bach's Wohltemperierte Klavier (WTK). The notated key was usually found after a few processing steps and from then on remained stable— but was still sensitive to modulation. The performance of the parallel-processing model was compared with the performance of key-finding models previously proposed by Krumhansl and Schmuckler and by Longuet-Higgins and Steedman. The comparison showed that the new model's most distinctive features, implementation of parallel key search in the scalar and chordal domains, as well as the implementation of search-restricting factors, primacy and memory, make the new model a powerful and plausible alternative to the other models. Subsequently, the parallel-processing model's perceptual plausibility has been tested in two experiments, in which 20 musically well-trained subjects had to produce the key(s) of eight WTK fugue themes (Experiment 1) and to rate the key transparency for seven contrapuntal variations of the A minor subject of J. S. Bach's Kunst der Fuge (Experiment 2). A substantial concordance between listeners' judgments and the key inferences produced by the model was found in both experiments. Conceptual limitations, such as the model's disregard for the potential impact of recency on key finding and for expectations from functional implications of tone order, are discussed. Potential extensions of the model are suggested, as well as ideas for further perceptual studies in which the model might be tested in a more advanced manner than in the present study.},

Understanding the interaction between these basic components is very important not only for achieving optimal performance, but also for assessing the potential and limitations of the system. Unfortunately, there are no studies that sufficiently evaluate the effects of the different approaches to each processing step and the interactions between these steps. In this paper we attempt to remedy this deficiency by performing a systematic evaluation encompassing a wide variety of techniques used for each processing step. In our study we find that filtering has a significant impact on performance, but providing musical context information in the transition matrix is rendered moot by the need to enforce continuity in the estimations. We discovered that the benefits of using complex chord models can be largely offset by an appropriate choice of features. In addition, the initial performance gap between different features were not fully compensated by any subsequent processing stages.},

Musically trained listeners were instructed to sing the musical scale that first came to mind immediately after hearing short excerpts from Preludes of J. S. Bach'sThe Well-Tempered Clavier. For each Prelude, the tonic (first note) and the mode (major or minor) of the scale produced were compared to the tonic and mode designated by Bach. Results indicated that listeners (1) often established the designated tonic and mode within the first four notes of the piece; (2) within the first four bars, often established tonalities different from that of the designated key, a tendency that increased by the eighth bar; and (3) reestablished the tonic in the last four bars. These observations validate, in general, music-theoretic assumptions about the listener's hearing of tonality, and raise issues regarding the salient relations that engage the cognitive structures underlying tonality perception.},

Like the earlier volume, this book is both a music-theoretic treatise and a contribution to the cognitive science of music. After presenting some modifications to Lerdahl and Jackendoff's original framework, the book develops a quantitative model of listeners' intuitions of the relative distances of pitches, chords, and regions from a given tonic. The model is used to derive prolongational structure, trace paths through pitch space at multiple prolongational levels, and compute patterns of tonal tension and attraction as musical events unfold. The consideration of pitch-space paths illuminates issues of musical narrative, and the treatment of tonal tension and attraction provides a technical basis for studies of musical expectation and expression. These investigations lead to a fresh theory of tonal function and reveal an underlying parallel between tonal and metrical structures. Later portions of the book apply these ideas to highly chromatic tonal as well as atonal music. In response to stylistic differences, the shape of pitch space changes and psychoacoustic features become increasingly important, while underlying features of the theory remain constant, reflecting unvarying features of the musical mind. The theory is illustrated throughout by analyses of music from Bach to Schoenberg, and frequent connections are made to the music-theoretic and psychological literature.},

The core of the method is a six-layered dynamic Bayesian network, in which the four hidden source layers jointly model metric position, key, chord, and bass pitch class, while the two observed layers model low-level audio features corresponding to bass and treble tonal content. Using 109 different chords our method provides substantially more harmonic detail than previous approaches while maintaining a high level of accuracy. We show that with 71\% correctly classified chords our method significantly exceeds the state of the art when tested against manually annotated ground truth transcriptions on the 176 audio tracks from the MIREX 2008 Chord Detection Task. We introduce a measure of segmentation quality and show that bass and meter modeling are especially beneficial for obtaining the correct level of granularity.},

To accomplish this, a statistical analysis method based on chroma feature covariance is proposed. It makes use of a large collection of western music to build a tonal profile. The obtained profile is compared to alternative tonal profiles proposed in the literature, either cognitively, perceptually, or theoretically inspired. The high degree of correlation we find between the covariance-based tonal profile proposed here and several ones proposed in the literature (reaching values higher than 0.9) is interpreted as evidence that human-derived profiles faithfully reflect the statistics of the musical input listeners have been exposed to. Furthermore, we show that very short time scales allow us to correctly predict these profiles, which brings us to discuss the role that local-scale implicit learning plays in building mental representations of tonality.},

And how do Chopin's works exploit the non-Euclidean geometry of musical chords?In this groundbreaking work, author Dmitri Tymoczko describes a new framework for thinking about music that emphasizes the commonalities among styles from medieval polyphony to contemporary rock. Tymoczko identifies five basic musical features that jointly contribute to the sense of tonality, and shows how these features recur throughout the history of Western music. In the process he sheds new light on an age-old question: what makes music sound good?A Geometry of Music provides an accessible introduction to Tymoczko's revolutionary geometrical approach to music theory. The book shows how to construct simple diagrams representing relationships among familiar chords and scales, giving readers the tools to translate between the musical and visual realms and revealing surprising degrees of structure in otherwise hard-to-understand pieces.Tymoczko uses this theoretical foundation to retell the history of Western music from the eleventh century to the present day. Arguing that traditional histories focus too narrowly on the "common practice" period from 1680-1850, he proposes instead that Western music comprises an extended common practice stretching from the late middle ages to the present. He discusses a host of familiar pieces by a wide range of composers, from Bach to the Beatles, Mozart to Miles Davis, and many in between.A Geometry of Music is accessible to a range of readers, from undergraduate music majors to scientists and mathematicians with an interest in music. Defining its terms along the way, it presupposes no special mathematical background and only a basic familiarity with Western music theory. The book also contains exercises designed to reinforce and extend readers' understanding, along with a series of appendices that explore the technical details of this exciting new theory.},

Close harmonic relations such as fifths and thirds appear as small Euclidian distances. We calculate the Euclidian distance between analysis frames n +1 and n -1 to develop a harmonic change measure for frame n. A peak in the detection function denotes a transition from one harmonically stable region to another. Initial experiments show that the algorithm can successfully detect harmonic changes such as chord boundaries in polyphonic audio recordings.},

People listening to music can easily hum the melody, clap hands in time to the musical beat, notice a phrase being repeated, and find chorus sections. The brain mechanisms underlying these abilities, however, are not yet well understood. In addition, it has been difficult to implement these abilities on a computer system, although a system with them is useful in various applications such as music information retrieval, music production/editing, and music interfaces. It is therefore an important challenge to build a music scene description system that can understand complex real-world music signals like those recorded on commercially distributed compact discs (CDs).},

The evidence is taken from unaccompanied melodic openings of compositions by Bach, Mozart, Brahms, and of national anthems, hymns, and folksongs. The implementation of the hitherto unrecognised rule in a computational key-finding model (Vos and Van Geenen, 1996) appeared to improve the validity of the model. 4/5 openings were additionally explored in relation to their concomitant metrical structures. 4/5 openings corresponded to upbeat/downbeat progressions in 99\% of surveyed German folksongs, but only 23\% of hymns. The findings are discussed with an emphasis on the need for more historical, music-theoretical, and perceptual research of musical openings.},

Four issues raised by Butler's (1989) commentary are addressed. The first issue is the possibility that the results of perceptual studies of tonal hierarchies can be attributed to task-specific strategies developed in response to particular stimuli. Such strategies cannot account for the convergence across experiments employing varied tasks and stimulus materials. The second issue is the correspondence between statistical summaries of music and perceptual data. The correspondence is shown to be quite general and to have implications for the acquisition of tonal knowledge. The third issue is the process listeners use to identify the tonal center. Patternmatching to tonal hierarchies is shown to be a plausible process contributing to key-finding, whereas a tritone rule has limited applicability. The final issue is the effect of temporal order on pitch perception. Principled temporal-order effects are found in many psychological experiments, but not in those focusing on the tritone relation.},

	abstract = {Strengths and limitations of the tonal hierarchy theory, and of the probetone testing procedure used to substantiate that theory, are discussed. The tonal hierarchy theory is characterized as an important contribution in that it begins to describe hierarchical relationships of tones in the diatonic set. The tonal hierarchy theory is, however, criticized because it does not describe the mental process or processes by which the tonal center of a piece of tonal music is recognized, nor does it account for the dynamic perception of tonality as it unfolds during actual musical listening. The probe-tone testing procedure most often used to substantiate the tonal hierarchy theory is criticized for the ambiguity of its response task, so that test results could be an artifact of effects of short-term memory. An alternative perceptual theory is proposed to describe the timedependent nature of pitch relationships in music. In this description, listeners are assumed to recognize the tonal center in tonal music on a bestevidence basis, and it is asserted that the clearest evidence is carried in the rarest-occurring intervals in the diatonic set. Evidence, gathered in a series of experiments, is cited to demonstrate that listeners both with and without extensive formal training in music form strong (and usually tacit) mental representations of unambiguous tonality when tones are arranged across time so as to form meaningful tonal referents.},

Our approach leverages the degree of harmonic information held within a musical audio signal (its "keyness") as well as the steadiness of local key detections across the its duration (its "stability"). Using this confidence measure, musical tracks which are likely to be misclassified, i.e. those with low confidence, can then be handled differently from those analysed by standard, fully automatic key detection methods. By means of a listening test, we demonstrate that our developed features significantly correlate with listeners' ratings of harmonic complexity, steadiness and the uniqueness of key. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tracks which are incorrectly labelled using an existing key detection system obtain low confidence values. Finally, we introduce a new method called "root note heuristics" for the special treatment of tracks with low confidence. We show that by applying these root note heuristics, key detection results can be improved for minimalistic music.},

We argue that a natural conclusion of this approach is that music theory, while already being a kind of folk psychology, can benefit from being more explicitly informed by music cognition studies. We give examples from work in the computational modelling of music cognition, following our approach, which attempts to place each musical phenomenon in an ecological context motivated by evolutionary considerations, and which aims to explain musical phenomena independently of the explicit intervention of the theorist. We argue that only thus can a theory be said veridically to explicate the phenomenology of music. We place our argument in context of the Generative Theory of Tonal Music (Lerdahl \& Jackendoff, 1983), Generative Linguistics, and other papers in the current volume, and compare them all with results of modelling studies based on our espoused approach.},

Particularly, concepts of historical periods have been criticized since they cannot account for the continuous and interwoven evolution of style. To systematically study this evolution, large corpora are necessary suggesting the use of computational strategies. This article presents such strategies and experiments relying on a dataset of 2000 audio recordings, which cover more than 300 years of music history. From the recordings, we extract different tonal features. We propose a method to visualize these features over the course of history using evolution curves. With the curves, we re-trace hypotheses concerning the evolution of chord transitions, intervals, and tonal complexity. Furthermore, we perform unsupervised clustering of recordings across composition years, individual pieces, and composers. In these studies, we found independent evidence of historical periods that broadly agrees with traditional views as well as recent data-driven experiments. This shows that computational experiments can provide novel insights into the evolution of styles.},

However, owing to the complexity of music and the sometimes ambiguous harmonic structure of polyphonic music, chord annotations are inherently subjective, and as a result any derived accuracy estimates will be subjective as well. In this paper, we investigate the extent of the confounding effect of subjectivity in reference annotations. Our results show that this effect is important, and they affect different types of automatic chord estimation systems in different ways. Our results have implications for research on automatic chord estimation, but also on other fields that evaluate performance by comparing against human provided annotations that are confounded by subjectivity.},

	abstract = {While there are many parallels between computing activities in musicology and those in other humanities disciplines, the particular nature of musical material and the ways in which this must be accommodated set many activities apart from those in text-based disciplines. As in other disciplines, early applications were beset by hardware constraints, which placed a premium on expertise and promoted design-intensive projects. Massive musical encoding and bibliographical projects were initiated. Diversification of hardware platforms and languages in the Seventies led to task-specific undertakings, including preliminary work on many of today's programs for music printing and analysis. The rise of personal computers and associated general-purpose software in the Eighties has enabled many scholars to pursue projects individually, particularly with the assistance of database, word processing, and notation software. Current issues facing the field include the need for standards for data interchange, the creation of banks of reusable data, the establishment of qualitative standards for encoded data, and the encouragement of realistic appraisals of what computers can do.The musicologist Eleanor Selfridge-Field, who is the author of three books on Italian music and numerous articles, editions, and reviews, has worked at CCARH since its founding in 1984. Her most recent book, The Music of Benedetto and Alessandro Marcello (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990), which contains 1300 musical examples, was produced from camera-ready copy supplied by CCARH.Drs.

	abstract = {This dissertation addresses the question of how musical pitches generate a tonal center. Being able to characterize the relationships that generate a tonal center is crucial to the computer analysis and the generating of western tonal music. It also can inform issues of compositional styles, structural boundaries, and performance decisions. The proposed Spiral Array model offers a parsimonious description of the inter-relations among tonal elements, and suggests new ways to re-conceptualize and reorganize musical information. The Spiral Array generates representations for pitches, intervals, chords and keys within a single spatial framework, allowing comparisons among elements from different hierarchical levels. Structurally, this spatial representation is a helical realization of the harmonic network (tonnetz). The basic idea behind the Spiral Array is the representation of higher level tonal elements as composites of their lower level parts. The Spiral Array assigns greatest prominence to perfect fifth and major /minor third interval relations, placing elements related by these intervals in proximity to each other. As a result, distances between tonal entities as represented spatially in the model correspond to perceived distances among sounding entities. The parameter values that affect proximity relations are prescribed based on a few perceived relations among pitches, intervals, chords and keys. This process of interfacing between the model and actual perception creates the opportunity to research some basic, but till now unanswered questions about the relationships that generate tonality. A generative model, the Spiral Array case; provides a framework on which to design viable and efficient algorithms for problems in music cognition. I demonstrate its versatility by applying the model to three different problems: I develop an algorithm to determine the key of musical passages that, on average, performs better than existing ones when applied to the 24 fugue subjects in Book I of Bach's WTC; I propose the first computationally viable method for determining modulations (the change of key); and, I design a basic algorithm for finding the roots of chords, comparing its results to those of algorithms by other researchers. All three algorithms were implemented in Matlab.},

In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables representing past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for HMMs and IOHMMs.},

During training, only the connections from the reservoir to these output units are learned. A key requisite for output-only training is the echo state property (ESP), which means that the effect of initial conditions should vanish as time passes. In this paper, we use analytical examples to show that a widely used criterion for the ESP, the spectral radius of the weight matrix being smaller than unity, is not sufficient to satisfy the echo state property. We obtain these examples by investigating local bifurcation properties of the standard ESNs. Moreover, we provide new sufficient conditions for the echo state property of standard sigmoid and leaky integrator ESNs. We furthermore suggest an improved technical definition of the echo state property, and discuss what practicians should (and should not) observe when they optimize their reservoirs for specific tasks.},

Researchers have previously addressed the issue of finding the key for symbolically encoded music (MIDI); however, very little work has been done on key detection for acoustic music. In this paper, we present a method for estimating the root of diatonic scale and the key directly from acoustic signals (waveform) of popular and classical music. We propose a method to extract pitch profile features from the audio signal, which characterizes the tone distribution in the music. The diatonic scale root and key are estimated based on the extracted pitch profile by using a tone clustering algorithm and utilizing the tone structure of keys. Experiments on 72 music pieces have been conducted to evaluate the proposed techniques. The success rate of scale root detection for pop music pieces is above 90\%.},

Ratings were well explained in terms of 3 factors: distance in pitch height from the context tones, octave equivalence, and a hierarchy of tonal functions (tonic tone, other tones of the major triad chord, other tones of the diatonic scale, and the nondiatonic tones). In these ratings, pitch height was more prominent for less musical listeners or with less musical (sinusoidal) tones, whereas octave equivalence and the tonal hierarchy prevailed for musical listeners, especially with harmonically richer tones. In a 2nd experiment with 8 undergraduates, ratings for quarter tones interpolated halfway between the halftone steps of the standard chromatic scale were approximately the averages of ratings for adjacent chromatic tones, suggesting failure to discriminate tones at this fine level of division.

	abstract = {Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch considers the problem of how listeners encode, organize, and remember pitch patterns in music. The work seeks to explicate the nature of listeners' knowledge of how pitch structures are formed, identify musical properties that shape this knowledge, and characterize the process through which sequences of sounds become coherent, memorable, and meaningful. The approach taken is that of cognitive psychology, in which laboratory methods examine the nature of mental representations and processes. Previous publications have described a number of the studies. They are summarized here together with new results, allowing richer connections to be drawn between the empirical findings. Theoretical and methodological issues surrounding the laboratory studies are also examined. The experiments focus primarily on pitch structures in traditional Western music. This choice of focus is based on the large corpus of literature in music theory that deals with this style. This literature has been important for designing the experimental materials and interpreting the results. A number of studies extend the methods to music outside this tradition. Throughout, care has been taken to provide adequate background in experimental methods and music theory so that no special background is needed to follow the major arguments. However, the reader will naturally discover certain topics to be of greater interest than others depending on his or her special expertise.

First, perceptrons are trained to associate standardized key profiles (taken from 1 of 3 different sources) to different musical keys. After training, we measured perceptron accuracy in asserting musical keys for 296 novel stimuli. Depending upon which key profiles were used during training, perceptrons can perform as well as established key-finding algorithms on this task. Further analyses indicate that perceptrons generate higher activity in a unit representing a selected key and much lower activities in the units representing the competing keys that are not selected than does a traditional algorithm. Finally, we examined the internal structure of trained perceptrons and discovered that they, unlike traditional algorithms, assign very different weights to different components of a key profile. Perceptrons learn that some profile components are more important for specifying musical key than are others. These differential weights could be incorporated into traditional algorithms that do not themselves employ artificial neural networks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Backpropagation is often viewed as a method for adapting artificial neural networks to classify patterns. Based on parts of the book by Rumelhart and colleagues, many authors equate backpropagation with the generalized delta rule applied to fully-connected feedforward networks. This paper will summarize a more general formulation of backpropagation, developed in 1974, which does more justice to the roots of the method in numerical analysis and statistics, and also does more justice to creative approaches expressed by neural modelers in the past year or two. It will discuss applications of backpropagation to forecasting over time (where errors have been halved by using methods other than least squares), to optimization, to sensitivity analysis, and to brain research. This paper will go on to derive a generalization of backpropagation to recurrent systems (which input their own output), such as hybrids of perceptron-style networks and Grossberg/Hopfield networks. Unlike the proposal of Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, this generalization does not require the storage of intermediate iterations to deal with continuous recurrence. This generalization was applied in 1981 to a model of natural gas markets, where it located sources of forecast uncertainty related to the use of least squares to estimate the model parameters in the first place.},

	abstract = {Because of the “all-or-none” character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

	abstract = {Throughout the common-practice period (1650–1900), it is customary to find changes of musical key within a piece of music. In current music theory terminology, the concepts of modulation and tonicization are helpful to explain many of these changes of key. Conversely, in computational musicology and music information retrieval, the preferred way to denote changes of key are local key features, which are oftentimes predicted by computational models. Therefore, the three concepts, local keys, modulations, and tonicizations describe changes of key. What is, however, the relationship between the local keys, modulations, and tonicizations of the same musical fragment? In this paper, we contribute to this research question by 1) reviewing the current methods of local-key estimation, 2) providing a new dataset with annotated modulations and tonicizations, and 3) applying all the annotations (i.e., local keys, modulations, and tonicizations) in an experiment that connects the three concepts together. In our experiment, instead of assuming the music-theoretical meaning of the local keys predicted by an algorithm, we evaluate whether these coincide better with the modulation or tonicization annotations of the same musical fragment. Three existing models of symbolic local-key estimation, together with the annotated modulations and tonicizations of five music theory textbooks are considered during our evaluation. We provide the methodology of our experiment and our dataset (available at https://github.com/DDMAL/key\_modulation\_dataset) to motivate future research in the relationship between local keys, modulations, and tonicizations.},

	abstract = {Score and audio ﬁles are the two most important ways to represent, convey, record, store, and experience music. While score describes a piece of music on an abstract level using symbols such as notes, keys, and measures, audio ﬁles allow for reproducing a speciﬁc acoustic realization of the piece. Each of these representations reﬂects diﬀerent facets of music yielding insights into aspects ranging from structural elements (e. g., motives, themes, musical form) to speciﬁc performance aspects (e. g., artistic shaping, sound). Therefore, the simultaneous access to score and audio representations is of great importance. In this paper, we address the problem of automatically generating musically relevant linking structures between the various data sources that are available for a given piece of music. In particular, we discuss the task of sheet musicaudio synchronization1 with the aim to link regions in images of scanned scores to musically corresponding sections in an audio recording of the same piece. Such linking structures form the basis for novel interfaces that allow users to access and explore multimodal sources of music within a single framework. As our main contributions, we give an overview of the state-of-the-art for this kind of synchronization task, we present some novel approaches, and indicate future research directions. In particular, we address problems that arise in the presence of structural diﬀerences and discuss challenges when applying optical music recognition to complex orchestral scores. Finally, potential applications of the synchronization results are presented.},

By identifying non-chord tones, the task of harmonic analysis is much simplified. Trained and tested on a dataset of 140 Bach chorales, an initial DNN was able to identify non-chord tones with F1-measure of 57.00\%, using pitch-class information alone. By adding metric information, a small size contextual window, and fine-tuning DNN, the model's accuracy increased to a F1-measure of 72.19\%. These results suggest that DNNs offer an innovative and promising approach to tackling the problem of non-chord tone identification, as well as harmonic analysis.},

Journalist Stephen Witt traces the secret history of digital music piracy, from the German audio engineers who invented the mp3, to a North Carolina compact-disc manufacturing plant where factory worker Dell Glover leaked nearly two thousand albums over the course of a decade, to the high-rises of midtown Manhattan where music executive Doug Morris cornered the global market on rap, and, finally, into the darkest recesses of the Internet. Through these interwoven narratives, Witt has written a thrilling book that depicts the moment in history when ordinary life became forever entwined with the world online--when, suddenly, all the music ever recorded was available for free. Witt introduces the unforgettable characters--inventors, executives, factory workers, and smugglers--who revolutionized an entire artform, and reveals for the first time the secret underworld of media pirates that transformed our digital lives.--From publisher description},

	url = {http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/273178},
	doi = {10.5075/epfl-thesis-9808},
	abstract = {Tonality has been the cornerstone of Western music-theoretical discourse for centuries. This study addresses the subject, using traditional music analysis, data-driven corpus methods, and computational models, concentrating on historical changes of tonality with a particular focus on the 19th century. The thesis engages three analytical levels of increasing scope - micro, meso, and macro - and is thus located between the poles of the particular and the general. The micro-level presents a detailed analysis of Franz Liszt's Sonetto 47 del Petrarca, S. 161, no. 4 (1858), in order to illustrate compositional innovations testifying to the radical changes in tonality within the 19th century. The analysis exemplifies how these novelties permeate musical compositions in that period, and also expose the benefits and limitations of manual music analysis. The meso-level examines a corpus of harmonic annotations of pieces by Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Liszt, Dvořák, Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and Medtner, containing over 75,000 chord symbols. It presents a comprehensive model for the analysis of chord symbols in large corpora in order to study chords and the progressions between them. Whilst the individual composers' chord vocabularies vary considerably - paying tribute to idiomatic usages of harmony - it is shown that the overarching similarities of the chord distributions point to similarities in their harmonic language that surpass individual traits and that can be modeled by Zipf's and Heaps's laws. An entropy-based method is presented to systematically study the effect of certain features on chord prediction, revealing that suspensions are the strongest predictors. The study shows that chord progressions are largely asymmetrical and proceed mostly by fifths; however, third-based progressions become increasingly prevalent within the studied period. The macro-level explores a corpus of nearly 3 million notes in more than 2000 pieces created by 75 composers, comprising a historical range of approximately 600 years. The encoding of the data distinguishes enharmonically equivalent notes, hence providing a larger note vocabulary than most previous approaches in empirical music research. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the line of fifths can be derived from the co-occurrence as well as the co-evolution of tonal pitch-classes. Moreover, the hierarchical topic model known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to discover latent tonal profiles. These largely correspond to distributions on contiguous line-of-fifths segments and moreover demonstrate the elevated roles of fifths as well as major and minor thirds as intervals between the most frequent notes. This motivates to model pieces as distributions on the Tonnetz. To that end, a new model, the Tonal Diffusion Model (TDM), is introduced. The results are obtained by fitting the model to the corpus and exhibit two trends. Over the entire historical period under consideration, notes are primarily distributed along the fifths axis of the Tonnetz. Furthermore, 19th-century composers also explore the major and minor thirds axes of the Tonnetz, extending their compositions in ever farther regions. The diverse methodology in this study provides quantitatively grounded insights from a range of perspectives, bridging the fields of music theory, computational musicology, mathematical modeling, and the digital humanities.},

	abstract = {Carl Schachter is, by common consent, one of the three or four most important music theorists currently at work in North America. He is the preeminent practitioner in the world of the Schenkerian approach to the music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which focuses on the linear organization of music and now dominates discussions of the standard repertoire in university courses and in professional journals. His articles have appeared in a variety of journals, including some that are obscure or hard to obtain. This volume gathers some of his finest essays, including those on rhythm in tonal music, Schenkerian theory, and text setting, as well as a pair of analytical monographs, on Bach's Fugue in B-flat major from Volume 1 of the Well-Tempered Clavier and Chopin's Fantasy, Op. 49.},

	abstract = {We examined a variety of real-time responses evoked by a single piece of music, the organ Duetto BWV 805 by J S Bach. The primary data came from a concurrent probe-tone method in which the probe tone is sounded continuously with the music. Listeners judged how well the probe tone fit with the music at each point in time. The process was repeated for all probe tones of the chromatic scale. A self-organizing map (SOM) [Kohonen 1997 Self-organizing Maps (Berlin: Springer)] was used to represent the developing and changing sense of key reflected in these judgments. The SOM was trained on the probe-tone profiles for 24 major and minor keys (Krumhansl and Kessler 1982 Psychological Review 89 334-368). Projecting the concurrent probe-tone data onto the map showed changes both in the perceived keys and in their strengths. Two dynamic models of tonality induction were tested. Model 1 is based on pitch class distributions. Model 2 is based on the tone-transition distributions; it tested the idea that the order of tones might provide additional information about tonality. Both models contained dynamic components for characterizing pitch strength and creating pitch memory representations. Both models produced results closely matching those of the concurrent probe-tone data. Finally real-time judgments of tension were measured. Tension correlated with distance away from the predominant key in the direction of keys built on the dominant and supertonic tones, and also correlated with dissonance.},

A Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (C-RBM) as a generative model is combined with gradient descent constraint optimisation to provide further control over the generation process. Among other things, this allows for the use of a "template" piece, from which some structural properties can be extracted, and transferred as constraints to the newly generated material. The sampling process is guided with Simulated Annealing to avoid local optima, and to find solutions that both satisfy the constraints, and are relatively stable with respect to the C-RBM. Results show that with this approach it is possible to control the higher-level self-similarity structure, the meter, and the tonal properties of the resulting musical piece, while preserving its local musical coherence.},

	abstract = {Modeling polyphonic music is a particularly challenging task because of the intricate interplay between melody and harmony. A good model should satisfy three requirements: statistical accuracy (capturing faithfully the statistics of correlations at various ranges, horizontally and vertically), flexibility (coping with arbitrary user constraints), and generalization capacity (inventing new material, while staying in the style of the training corpus). Models proposed so far fail on at least one of these requirements. We propose a statistical model of polyphonic music, based on the maximum entropy principle. This model is able to learn and reproduce pairwise statistics between neighboring note events in a given corpus. The model is also able to invent new chords and to harmonize unknown melodies. We evaluate the invention capacity of the model by assessing the amount of cited, re-discovered, and invented chords on a corpus of Bach chorales. We discuss how the model enables the user to specify and enforce user-defined constraints, which makes it useful for style-based, interactive music generation.},

We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. DeepBach's strength comes from the use of pseudo-Gibbs sampling coupled with an adapted representation of musical data. This is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which tend to compose music sequentially. Our model is also steerable in the sense that a user can constrain the generation by imposing positional constraints such as notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. We also provide a plugin on top of the MuseScore music editor making the interaction with Deep-Bach easy to use.},

VAEs are appealing because they are built on top of standard function approximators (neural networks), and can be trained with stochastic gradient descent. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of complicated data, including handwritten digits, faces, house numbers, CIFAR images, physical models of scenes, segmentation, and predicting the future from static images. This tutorial introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior. No prior knowledge of variational Bayesian methods is assumed.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition.},

As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate. The upper bound is obtained for a specific probabilistic nonsequential decoding algorithm which is shown to be asymptotically optimum for rates aboveR\_0and whose performance bears certain similarities to that of sequential decoding algorithms.},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Vibrato is a slightly tremulous effect imparted to vocal or instrumental tone for added warmth and expressiveness through slight variation in pitch. It corresponds to a periodic fluctuation of the fundamental frequency. It is common for a singer to develop a vibrato function to personalize his/her singing style. In this paper, we explore the acoustic features that reflect vibrato information in order to identify singers of popular music. We start with an enhanced vocal detection method that allows us to select vocal segments with high confidence. From the selected vocal segments, the cepstral coefficients which reflect the vibrato characteristics are computed. These coefficients are derived using bandpass filters, such as parabolic and cascaded bandpass filters, spread according to the octave frequency scale. The strategy of our classifier formulation is to utilize the high level musical knowledge of song structure in singer modeling. Singer identification is validated on a database containing 84 popular songs from commercially available CD recordings from 12 singers. We achieve an average error rate of 16.2\% in segment level identification},

Delta regression and various statistical functionals can be applied to the low-level descriptors. openSMILE is implemented in C++ with no third-party dependencies for the core functionality. It is fast, runs on Unix and Windows platforms, and has a modular, component based architecture which makes extensions via plug-ins easy. It supports on-line incremental processing for all implemented features as well as off-line and batch processing. Numeric compatibility with future versions is ensured by means of unit tests. openSMILE can be downloaded from http://opensmile.sourceforge.net/.},

Music is one of the most popular types of online information and there are now hundreds of music streaming and download services operating on the World-Wide Web. Some of the music collections available are approaching the scale of ten million tracks and this has posed a major challenge for searching, retrieving, and organizing music content. Research efforts in music information retrieval have involved experts from music perception, cognition, musicology, engineering, and computer science engaged in truly interdisciplinary activity that has resulted in many proposed algorithmic and methodological solutions to music search using content-based methods. This paper outlines the problems of content-based music information retrieval and explores the state-of-the-art methods using audio cues (e.g., query by humming, audio fingerprinting, content-based music retrieval) and other cues (e.g., music notation and symbolic representation), and identifies some of the major challenges for the coming years.},

This representation is evaluated in the context of automatic musical genre classification. A multiple-pitch detection algorithm for polyphonic signals is used to calculate Pitch Histograms for audio signals. In order to evaluate the extent and significance of errors resulting from the automatic multiple-pitch detection, automatic musical genre classification results from symbolic and audio data are compared.

	abstract = {It is as performance that music is loved, understood, and consumed, yet musicologists have traditionally treated it as a kind of text. They have seen meaning as written into the music, implying that performance merely reproduces what is already there: this paradigm of reproduction has prevented musicology from adequately engaging with performance. Beyond the Score is a thoroughgoing attempt to reconceive music as performance, in other words as a real-time practice that affords the production of meaning. That means rethinking familiar assumptions and developing new approaches. Focusing primarily but not exclusively on the Western “art” tradition, the book explores perspectives that range from close listening to computational analysis, from ethnography to the study of recordings, and from the social relations constructed through performance to the performing (and listening) body. It also has a strong historical emphasis, extending from the early days of recording to contemporary digital culture, and a number of themes weave through it. These include the relationship between the written and the oral in musical culture, and the need to move on from thinking based on the paradigm of reproduction to a semiotic approach grounded on the production of meaning. While the principal claim of the book is that thinking based on the idea of music as text has hampered the academic understanding of music, the book argues that it has also made the practices of performance less creative than they might be, and the book explores how we might escape from the textualist straitjacket.},

Pieces of music are first sampled to pitch–time representations (spectrograms or piano-rolls) and then convolved with a Gaussian filter, before being classified by a support vector machine or by k-nearest neighbours in an ensemble of classifiers. On the well-studied task of discriminating between string quartet movements by Haydn and Mozart, we obtain accuracies that equal the state of the art on two data-sets. However, in multi-class composer identification, methods specialised for classifying symbolic representations of music are more effective. We also performed experiments on symbolic representations, synthetic audio and two different recordings of The Well-Tempered Clavier by J. S. Bach to study the method’s capacity to distinguish preludes from fugues. Our experimental results show that our approach performs similarly on symbolic representations, synthetic audio and audio recordings, setting our method apart from most previous studies that have been designed for use with either audio or symbolic data, but not both.},

To reduce the interference often caused by percussive sounds in popular music, we use Harmonic/Percussive Sound Separation (HPSS) technique to suppress percussive sounds and to emphasize harmonic sound components. We also use the Fourier transform of chroma to approximately diagonalize the covariance matrix of feature parameters so as to reduce the number of model parameters without degrading performance. It is shown that HMM with the new features yields higher recognition rates (the best in MIREX 2008 audio chord detection task) than that with conventional features.},

In the latter method, different instrument combinations are modelled, and an additional "silence" model is created. The proposed methods are evaluated with simulations with acoustic data, and compared with two reference methods. Simulations show that combination modelling performs better than instrument-wise modelling},

	abstract = {Automatic music processing poses a number of challenging questions because of the complexity and diversity of music data. As discussed in Sect. 2.1, one generally has to account for various aspects such as the data format (e.g., score, MIDI, audio), the instrumentation (e.g., orchestra, piano, drums, voice), and many other parameters such as articulation, dynamics, or tempo. To make music data comparable and algorithmically accessible, the first step in all music processing tasks is to extract suitable features that capture relevant key aspects while suppressing irrelevant details or variations. Here, the notion of similarity is of crucial importance in the design of audio features. In some applications and particularly in the case in music retrieval, one may be interested in characterizing an audio recording irrespective of certain details concerning the interpretation or instrumentation. Conversely, other applications may be concerned with measuring just the niceties that relate to a musician’s individual articulation or emotional expressiveness.},

However, these methods are necessarily media dependent. We present a system for producing short, representative samples (or "audio thumbnails") of selections of popular music. The system searches for structural redundancy within a given song with the aim of identifying something like a chorus or refrain. To isolate a useful class of features for performing such structure-based pattern recognition, we present a development of the chromagram, a variation on traditional time-frequency distributions that seeks to represent the cyclic attribute of pitch perception, known as chroma. The pattern recognition system itself employs a quantized chromagram that represents the spectral energy at each of the 12 pitch classes. We evaluate the system on a database of popular music and score its performance against a set of "ideal" thumbnail locations. Overall performance is found to be quite good, with the majority of errors resulting from songs that do not meet our structural assumptions.},

The purpose of this study was to provide evidence for the perceptual component of an analysis of pitch relationships in tonal music that includes consideration of both formal analytic systems and musical listeners' responses to tonal relationships in musical contexts. It was hypothesized (1) that perception of tonal centers in music develops from listeners' interpretations of time-dependent contextual (functional) relationships among pitches, rather than primarily through knowledge of psychoacoustical or structural characteristics of the pitch content of sets or scales and (2) that critical perceptual cues to functional relationships among pitches are provided by the manner in which particular intervallic relationships are expressed in musical time. Excerpts of tonal music were chosen to represent familiar harmonic relationships across a spectrum of tonal ambiguity/specificity. The pitch-class sets derived from these excerpts were ordered: (1) to evoke the same tonic response as the corresponding musical excerpt, 2) to evoke another tonal center, and (3) to be tonally ambiguous. The effect of the intervallic contents of musical excerpts and strings of pitches in determining listeners' choices of tonic and the effect of contextual manipulations of tones in the strings in directing subjects' responses were measured and compared. Results showed that the musically trained listeners in the study were very sensitive to tonal implications of temporal orderings of pitches in determining tonal centers. Temporal manipulations of intervallic relationships in stimuli had significant effects on concurrences of tonic responses and on tonal clarity ratings reported by listeners. The interval rarest in the diatonic set, the tritone, was the interval most effective in guiding tonal choices. These data indicate that perception of tonality is too complex a phenomenon to be explained in the time-independent terms of psychoacoustics or pitch- class collections, that perceived tonal relationships are too flexible to be forced into static structural representations, and that a functional interpretation of rare intervals in optimal temporal orderings in musical contexts is a critical feature of tonal listening strategy.},

THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE DISTRIBUTIONAL VIEW OF key-finding, which holds that listeners identify key by monitoring the distribution of pitch-classes in a piece and comparing this to an ideal distribution for each key. In our experiment, participants judged the key of melodies generated randomly from pitch-class distributions characteristic of tonal music. Slightly more than half of listeners' judgments matched the generating keys, on both the untimed and the timed conditions. While this performance is much better than chance, it also indicates that the distributional view is far from a complete explanation of human key identification. No difference was found between participants with regard to absolute pitch ability, either in the speed or accuracy of their key judgments. Several key-finding models were tested on the melodies to see which yielded the best match to participants' responses.},

By identifying spectral components that differ by a musical octave, chroma features possess a considerable amount of robustness to changes in timbre and instrumentation. In this paper, we describe a novel procedure that further enhances chroma features by significantly boosting the degree of timbre invariance without degrading the features' discriminative power. Our idea is based on the generally accepted observation that the lower mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are closely related to timbre. Now, instead of keeping the lower coefficients, we discard them and only keep the upper coefficients. Furthermore, using a pitch scale instead of a mel scale allows us to project the remaining coefficients onto the 12 chroma bins. We present a series of experiments to demonstrate that the resulting chroma features outperform various state-of-the art features in the context of music matching and retrieval applications. As a final contribution, we give a detailed analysis of our enhancement procedure revealing the musical meaning of certain pitch-frequency cepstral coefficients.},

We introduce a series of examples in which different encodings effectively modify the content of two---apparently equivalent---symbolic music files. These examples have been obtained from comparing three different encodings of a string quartet movement by Ludwig van Beethoven. We present two scenarios in which encoding discrepancies may be introduced. In the first scenario, they have been introduced during the encoding of the symbolic music file by either the music notation software or the human encoder. The discrepancies introduced in this scenario are typically difficult to notice because they are visually identical to an accurate encoding. In the second scenario, the discrepancies have been introduced during the translation of the original file into other symbolic formats. In this scenario, the discrepancies may be related to propagating errors in the original encoding or to an erroneous translation of certain attributes of the musical content. Finally, we discuss the possibility of using the examples provided here for the mitigation of some of these discrepancies in the future.},

Listeners rated how well single tones (any one of the 12 tones of the chromatic scale) followed a musical element such as a scale, chord, or cadence. Stable rating profiles reflecting the tonal hierarchies in major and minor keys were obtained, which, when intercorrelated and analyzed using multidimensional scaling, produced a 4-dimensional spatial map of the distances between keys. Listeners integrated harmonic functions over multiple chords, developing a sense of key that needed to be re-evaluated as additional chords were sounded. It is suggested that the perceived relations between chords and keys and between different keys are mediated through an internal representation of the hierarchy of tonal functions of single tones in music.

The first is the fuzziness of the key notion "tonality" itself, which leads to divergent conceptualizations of tonality induction, such as "key finding," "tonal induction," "tonal center perception," and "tonal feeling." I argue that the fuzziness is largely due to the lack of welldefined historical or otherwise categorical boundaries of "Western tonal music." The second impediment arises from various dualities in music, notably tone versus note representations, tonal versus intervallic representations, horizontal ("leading voice") cues for tonality induction versus vertical ones ("fundamentals"), and tonal versus temporal tonality induction cues. (Dis) advantages of various interpretations of tonality induction and of solutions of the dualities in question are considered. A few recommendations for reconciliation between currently divergent theoretical approaches to tonality induction are suggested.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

The study proposes a tool for determination of a time dependent tonal context vector for melodies from acoustical input. Each element of this vector, called a tonal component, indicates the extent of a specific scale usage. The system is made up of two stages: The first is involved in digital signal processing and is used to convert sound input of melodies into a sequence of musical note intervals and their associated occurrence times. The second stage uses finite state automats to match patterns of the interval sequences with pre-programmed scale patterns. The output consists of a time dependent tonal context vector whose elements are relative strengths of various tonal components regarding the melody under consideration.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

This dissertation presents computational methods for examining the temporality of music at multiple time-scales so that both short-term surface features and deeper long-term structures can be studied and related to each other. The methods are applied in particular to musical key analysis (Chapters 2-4) and also adapted for use in performance analysis (Chapters 5-6). The essential methodology is to examine all sequential time-scales within a piece using some analytic process and then arrange a summary of the analytic results into a maximally overlapped arrangement. Chapter 2 defines a two-dimensional plotting domain for displaying musical features at all possible time-scales which forms a basis for further analysis methods. The resulting structures in the plots can be examined subjectively as a navigational aid in the music as illustrated in Chapters 3 and 5. They can also be used to extract musically relevant information as discussed in Chapters 4 and 6.},

	abstract = {Key finding is an integral step in content-based music indexing and retrieval. In this paper, we present an O(n) real-time algorithm for determining key from polyphonic audio. We use the standard Fast Fourier Transform with a local maximum detection scheme to extract pitches and pitch strengths from polyphonic audio. Next, we use Chew's Spiral Array Center of Effect Generator (CEG) algorithm to determine the key from pitch strength information. We test the proposed system using Mozart's Symphonies. The test data is audio generated from MIDI source. The algorithm achieves a maximum correct key recognition rate of 96\% within the first fifteen seconds, and exceeds 90\% within the first three seconds. Starting from the extracted pitch strength information, we compare the CEG algorithm's performance to the classic Krumhansl-Schmuckler (K-S) probe tone profile method and Temperley's modified version of the K-S method. Correct key recognition rates for the K-S and modified K-S methods remain under 50\% in the first three seconds, with maximum values of 80\% and 87\% respectively within the first fifteen seconds for the same test set. The CEG method consistently scores higher throughout the fifteen-second selections.},

The algorithm achieved 94.98\% accuracy on the pitches that required accidentals in the local key and 99.686\% overall. Voice-leading resolution was found to be the best feature of those used to infer the correct spelling. Also, this paper outlines great potential for improvement under this model.},

The distance between keys, or modulation distance, was either zero, one, or two steps in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction on the cycle of fifths. Presentation conditions were four-voice harmonic sequences excerpted from the complete set of Bach chorales, single voices of the latter sequences, four-voice harmonic sequences simplified to block chords, and single voices of the latter sequences. Consistent with earlier findings (Thompson \& Cuddy, 1989), judgments for both four- voice harmonic presentations and single-voice presentations revealed a close correspondence between modulation distance and judged distance. Ratings for harmonic sequences within a given key distance, however, showed influences of direction of modulation and of harmonic progression that were not reflected in ratings for single voices. The findings suggest that harmony and melody follow somewhat different principles in the process of identifying key change.},

	abstract = {"I consider him a genius," remarked Arnold Schoenberg of the progressive early modernist Max Reger (1873–1916). In addition to his international renown as a teacher, conductor, and pianist, Reger wrote more than 1,000 works in virtually every musical genre. Many scholars and musicians credit him with emancipating dissonance to a level that assisted Schoenberg's development of serialism in the 1920s. Reger's influence extends to other 20th-century composers, including Béla Bártok, Alban Berg, Arthur Honegger, Paul Hindemith, and Sergei Prokofiev.Modulation — the change from one key to another — is a subject of critical importance to performers and composers in their study of harmony. Reger wrote this concise guide to modulation while teaching composition at Leipzig Conservatory, and the work continues to provide valuable insights and instruction for musicians at all levels. This new edition features newly engraved musical examples.},

We propose to address the problem of local key ﬁnding by investigating the possible combination and extension of different previous proposed global key estimation approaches. The speciﬁcity of our approach is that we introduce key dependency on the harmonic and the metric structures. In this work, we focus on the relationship between the chord progression and the local key progression in a piece of music. A contribution of our work is that we address the problem of ﬁnding a good analysis window length for local key estimation by introducing information related to the metric structure in our model. Key estimation is not performed on empirical-chosen segment length but on segments that are adapted to the analyzed piece and independent from the tempo. We evaluate and analyze our results on a new database composed of classical music pieces.},

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using feature learning and deep architectures instead, thus reducing the required engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge.

In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to apply feature learning directly to raw audio signals. We train convolutional neural networks using both approaches and compare their performance on an automatic tagging task. Although they do not outperform a spectrogram-based approach, the networks are able to autonomously discover frequency decompositions from raw audio, as well as phase-and translation-invariant feature representations.},

A fundamental assumption of distributional key-finding methods is that the frequency distributions of pitch classes in all keys are transpositionally equivalent. We tested this assumption with three experiments. First, using data from the openings of 995 major-key pieces and 596 minor-key pieces in the Yale-Classical Archives Corpus, we found that scale-degree distributions differ significantly from one key to another, and further analysis revealed that pieces keys with signatures having relatively more accidentals exhibit significantly more chromaticism than keys with fewer accidentals. Second, we examined whether these data might be accounted for by different keys’ varying modulation tendencies, and found this to be the case: keys with more accidentals modulate more frequently to more distant keys. Finally, we attempted to exclude modulatory passages from our data using a key profile analysis to identify key and mode within our dataset; however, the results of Experiment 1 still held. In sum, even when using a method that assumes transpositional equivalence, we found a difference between key profiles of different keys.},

The framework is formulated in terms of acoustic models for both keys and chords, and a prior model that contains musicological knowledge about chords and keys. The latter consists of a compound of four components: a duration and a change model for both keys and chords. This division allows us to modify each of the components separately and to choose the most appropriate sources of knowledge for each of them. Furthermore, this makes it easier to interpret their role and their relevance in the estimation procedure. We compared multiple configurations of our system, increasing in complexity. This has permitted us to explore the relation between keys and chords, and the importance of integrating prior musicological knowledge into an automatic estimation system. It was found that chord estimation scores mostly depend on the integration of durational knowledge, while key estimation also requires prior information about the broader context.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

The choice of chord profiles and higher-level time-series modelling have received a lot of attention, resulting in methods with an overall performance of more than 70\% in the MIREX Chord Detection task 2009. Research on the front end of chord transcription algorithms has often concentrated on finding good chord templates to fit the chroma features. In this paper we reverse this approach and seek to find chroma features that are more suitable for usage in a musically-motivated model. We do so by performing a prior approximate transcription using an existing technique to solve non-negative least squares problems (NNLS). The resulting NNLS chroma features are tested by using them as an input to an existing state-of-the-art high-level model for chord transcription. We achieve very good results of 80\% accuracy using the song collection and metric of the 2009 MIREX Chord Detection tasks. This is a significant increase over the top result (74\%) in MIREX 2009. The nature of some chords makes their identification particularly susceptible to confusion between fundamental frequency and partials. We show that the recognition of these diffcult},

The acoustic and language model predictions are combined using a probabilistic graphical model. Inference over the output variables is performed using the beam search algorithm. We perform two sets of experiments. We investigate various neural network architectures for the acoustic models and also investigate the effect of combining acoustic and music language model predictions using the proposed architecture. We compare performance of the neural network-based acoustic models with two popular unsupervised acoustic models. Results show that convolutional neural network acoustic models yield the best performance across all evaluation metrics. We also observe improved performance with the application of the music language models.

We avoid the extremely laborious task of human annotation of chord names and boundaries-which must be done to provide machine learning models with ground truth-by performing automatic harmony analysis on symbolic music files. In parallel, we synthesize audio from the same symbolic files and extract acoustic feature vectors which are in perfect alignment with the labels. We, therefore, generate a large set of labeled training data with a minimal amount of human labor. This allows for richer models. Thus, we build 24 key-dependent HMMs, one for each key, using the key information derived from symbolic data. Each key model defines a unique state-transition characteristic and helps avoid confusions seen in the observation vector. Given acoustic input, we identify a musical key by choosing a key model with the maximum likelihood, and we obtain the chord sequence from the optimal state path of the corresponding key model, both of which are returned by a Viterbi decoder. This not only increases the chord recognition accuracy, but also gives key information. Experimental results show the models trained on synthesized data perform very well on real recordings, even though the labels automatically generated from symbolic data are not 100\% accurate. We also demonstrate the robustness of the tonal centroid feature, which outperforms the conventional chroma feature.},

Certain tones serve as reference pitches; they are stable, repeated frequently, are emphasized rhythmically, and appear at structurally important positions in musical phrases. The details of the hierarchies differ across styles and cultures. Variation occurs in the particular intervals formed by pitches in the musical scale and the hierarchical levels assigned to pitches within the scale. This variability suggests that an explanation for how these hierarchies are formed cannot be derived from invariant acoustic facts, such as the harmonic structure (overtones) of complex tones. Rather, the evidence increasingly suggests that these hierarchies are products of cognition and, moreover, that they rely on fundamental psychological principles shared by other domains of perception and cognition.},

These parameters are then used to determine the key and vocabulary items used in an unanalyzed piece of music.

Both authors analysed all 100 songs by hand, using conventional Roman numeral symbols. Agreement between the two sets of analyses was over 90 per cent. The analyses were encoded using a recursive notation, similar to a context-free grammar, allowing repeating sections to be encoded succinctly. The aggregate data was then subjected to a variety of statistical analyses. We examined the frequency of different chords and chord transitions. The results showed that IV is the most common chord after I and is especially common preceding the tonic. Other results concern the frequency of different root motions, patterns of co-occurrence between chords, and changes in harmonic practice across time.},

Six core principles are shown to account for the majority of voice-leading rules given in historical and contemporary music theory tracts. These principles are treated in a manner akin to axioms in a formal system from which the traditional rules of voice-leading are derived. Nontraditional rules arising from the derivation are shown to predict formerly unnoticed aspects of voice-leading practice. In addition to the core perceptual principles, several auxiliary principles are described. These auxiliary principles are occasionally linked to voice-leading practice and may be regarded as compositional "options" that shape the music-making in perceptually unique ways. It is suggested that these auxiliary principles distinguish different types of part writing, such as polyphony, homophony, and close harmony. A theory is proposed to account for the aesthetic origin of voice-leading practices.},

This model is feature-based, quantifying the desirability of a given voice leading on the basis of different features derived from Huron’s (2001) perceptual account of voice leading. We use the model to analyze a corpus of 370 chorale harmonizations by J. S. Bach, and demonstrate the model’s application to the voicing of harmonic progressions in different musical genres. The model is implemented in a new R package, “voicer,” which we release alongside this paper.},

With glee people love to point out how works from the repertoire frequently feature elements that are forbidden in exercises, thereby seeming to prove the ineptitude of the arcane rules forced upon generations of students. Considering the glaring divide between compositional practice and the guidelines for these exercises, are there truly any benefits for continuing to teach in this old-fashioned manner? If their purpose is to mimic a specific artistic style, such as witnessed in the chorales of J. S. Bach, then the utility of part-writing exercises would indeed be extremely questionable. But if their goals are more properly understood as a means of enhancing sensitivity to certain basic procedures of tonal music, then part-writing exercises could rightly be valued as important pedagogical tools for developing vital skills that in turn can inform the performance, hearing, analysis, and composition of tonal music.},

This volume takes a unique approach to provide resources for both the conceptual and pragmatic sides of music theory pedagogy. Each section includes thematic 'anchor' chapters that address key issues, accompanied by short 'topics' chapters offering applied examples that instructors can readily adopt in their own teaching. In eight parts, leading pedagogues from across North America explore how to most effectively teach the core elements of the music theory curriculum: Fundamentals, Rhythm and Meter, Core Curriculum, Aural Skills, Post-Tonal Theory, Form, Popular Music, Who, What, and How We Teach A broad musical repertoire demonstrates formal principles that transcend the Western canon, catering to a diverse student body with diverse musical goals. Reflecting growing interest in the field, and with an emphasis on easy implementation, The Routledge Companion to Music Theory Pedagogy presents strategies and challenges to illustrate and inspire, in a comprehensive resource for all teachers of music theory"--},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

The field of Automatic Chord Recognition (ACR) has evolved considerably from early knowledge-based systems towards data-driven methods, with neural network approaches arguably being central to current ACR research. Nonetheless, many of its core issues were already addressed or referred to in the Fujishima paper. In this paper, we review those twenty years of ACR according to these issues.

	abstract = {A Bayesian model of learning to learn by sampling from multiple tasks is presented. The multiple tasks are themselves generated by sampling from a distribution over an environment of related tasks. Such an environment is shown to be naturally modelled within a Bayesian context by the concept of an objective prior distribution. It is argued that for many common machine learning problems, although in general we do not know the true (objective) prior for the problem, we do have some idea of a set of possible priors to which the true prior belongs. It is shown that under these circumstances a learner can use Bayesian inference to learn the true prior by learning sufficiently many tasks from the environment. In addition, bounds are given on the amount of information required to learn a task when it is simultaneously learnt with several other tasks. The bounds show that if the learner has little knowledge of the true prior, but the dimensionality of the true prior is small, then sampling multiple tasks is highly advantageous. The theory is applied to the problem of learning a common feature set or equivalently a low-dimensional-representation (LDR) for an environment of related tasks.},

This dissertation reports a research-creation approach for the development of a framework for Creative Music Learning with Technology (CMLT), which emphasizes a process of learning to interact creatively with music. Theoretical analysis of improvisation pedagogy and technology for learning to improvise provide the foundation for creative experimentation. An examination of existing technologies reveals a lack of available tools for cultivating a creative disposition to musicianship. As a result, a prototype application was built for iPad and iPhone based on the principles of the CMLT framework. The software is at once a tool for developing musical understanding and for exploring creative freedom in music. A two-phased study of middle school instrumentalists and expert teachers examined the effectiveness of the prototype. In the first phase, seven expert music teachers and eight middle school instrumental students participated in user testing, revealing that the prototype effectively engaged users in learning many key objectives of improvisation pedagogy. In the second phase, six middle school students reported increased confidence after using the prototype for four weeks. Results suggest there is a strong potential for the framework for CMLT to positively enhance creative music learning.},

Some chapters are defined chronologically within a restricted historical domain, whilst others are defined conceptually and span longer historical periods. Together the thirty-one chapters present a synthetic overview of the fascinating and complex subject that is historical music theory. Richly enhanced with illustrations, graphics, examples and cross-citations as well as being thoroughly indexed and supplemented by comprehensive bibliographies of the most important primary and secondary literature, this book will be an invaluable resource for students and scholars alike.},

	abstract = {As a music-theoretical term, “tonality” was first used by Alexander Choron in 1810 to describe the arrangement of the dominant and subdominant above and below the tonic and thus to differentiate the harmonic organization of modern music (tonalité moderne) from that of earlier music (tonalité antique). One of the main conceptual categories in Western musical thought, tonality most often refers to the orientation of melodies and harmonies toward a referential (or tonic) pitch class. In the broadest possible sense, however, it refers to systematic arrangements of pitch phenomena and relations between them.UsageA number of musical and discursive factors have contributed to a veritable profusion of definitions for the term. To begin with, there has been considerable indecision about what musical domain the term covers: whether it applies to both Western and non-Western music, or whether, within Western musical traditions, the term can be restricted to the harmonic organization of music from the so-called common practice (1600–1910) or includes all music that evinces a basic difference between consonance and dissonance. There have also been some basic theoretical disagreements about whether its constituent musical elements are melodies or harmonies: however narrow the definition given to the term, the domain of tonal music is so enormous, diverse, and complex that one can choose almost any combination of musical phenomena and theoretical principles as the basis for discussion. In addition to these musical problems, enormous discursive difficulties have arisen from the conceptual languages used to describe tonal phenomena, theoretical vocabularies that vary dramatically according to the aesthetic and epistemological commitments of the writer.},

Human vision, for instance, is so immensely complex, with numerous specialized parts both in the eye itself and in the way that the brain processes visual signals, that it is difficult to imagine how each component evolved both separately and in interaction with its affiliates before the final, highly integrated developmental stage existed. The same is true of complex cultural systems that have evolved over long periods of time, among which is harmonic tonality. Virtually every aspect of harmonic tonality (tertian harmonies as primary compositional structures, contrapuntal voice leading connecting those harmonies, the bass as a harmonic foundation, notions of root generation, harmonic motion directed toward cadential goals, the interaction of diatonic scales and chromaticism, and the interaction of harmony and counterpoint with rhythm and meter) arose before tonal harmonic syntax existed. Even though those components interact quite intricately in tonal music, each arose within different musical contexts, and each was explained autonomously by teachings having long, independent theoretical traditions.The individual who first recognized that all those components interacted to create a sense of tonality was the French theorist and composer Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683–1764). Although Rameau proposed some original ideas, a major part of his theorizing in the treatises he published between 1722 and 1761 consisted of reformulating and combining long-standing concepts into a single harmonic, directional perspective. Rameau is an instance of that relatively rare theorist who was a major composer as well. Because of this, as much as he pursued theoretical ideas for their own consistency, he generally remembered that the function of a theory of harmony was to explain music as he understood it compositionally. This chapter traces many of these concepts and their attendant pedagogical traditions as inherited by the early eighteenth century, and then considers Rameau’s brilliant accomplishment of consolidating them into a unified (if not completely stabilized) harmonic theory. Lastly, this chapter surveys the evolving legacy of this now-dominant heritage in the late eighteenth century and beyond.},

	abstract = {Today most scholars agree that Rameau was the founder of modern harmonic theory. As we have seen in the previous chapter, Rameau attempted to synthesize in his many writings a multiplicity of ideas – both old and new, speculative and practical – into a unified theory of tonal harmony grounded upon a single underlying principle, the corps sonore (see Chapter 24, pp. 759–71). If he did not succeed in creating a truly systematic and stable theory of harmony owing to his many differing and often contradictory theoretical arguments and intellectual borrowings, he nonetheless bequeathed to the nineteenth century a number of compelling and richly suggestive ideas that would inspire theorists in their own efforts.In this chapter, we will look at the evolution of harmonic theory in the nineteenth century. This is of course a vast and complex topic. Given the profound changes in harmonic language between 1800 and 1900 – a period covering the end of Viennese Classicism and closing with Schoenberg’s first tentative steps beyond the tonal system – it is not surprising that theorists expended extraordinary energy and efforts in their attempts to rationalize this shifting practice. As it is impossible here to describe all of these efforts in detail, we will limit our scope to the development of Austro-German harmonic theory, a tradition which arguably encompasses some of the most innovative and influential writings on this topic for the entire century. Within this tradition, three individual trajectories can be traced back by differing routes to Rameau’s own theory: scale-degree (Stufen) theory, fundamental-bass theory, and function theory.},

	abstract = {Long after his major writings on harmony, counterpoint and analysis began to appear, Heinrich Schenker (1868–1935) remains one of the most important and influential theorists in the history of Western music. His achievements have often been compared to those of eminent thinkers of his age working in other fields, e.g., his Viennese compatriots Sigmund Freud in psychology and Albert Einstein in physics. His influence, modest (though not negligible) in his own lifetime, has grown steadily since the middle of the last century and shows no signs of abating. Already a paradigmatic figure in North American universities by the 1970s, he has since exerted a powerful influence in British and, more recently, European academic circles. Indeed, the interest shown in his life’s work is, in some respects, comparable to that of some of the twentieth century’s leading composers, and in this respect his reputation as a theorist is unequaled.That which is called “Schenkerian theory” is a complex set of regulatory principles that were initially intended to explain the tonal music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; it is at the same time a synthesis of many traditions, embracing Fuxian counterpoint, the thorough-bass teaching of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and late nineteenth-century harmonic theory. It is at once a sophisticated explanation of tonality, but also an analytical system of immense empirical power. Schenker’s ideas and work touch on, or have implications for, virtually every topic addressed in this volume.This chapter includes a synopsis of Schenker’s life and works, an explanation of the rudiments of his theory, remarks on its historical background, and a survey of its reception both as a pedagogical tool and as a basis for further investigation of a wide range of music.},

	abstract = {This thesis, titled Fifhs and octaves prohibited in the modal- tonal era, presents a study of sequences of consecutive fifths and octaves throughout the history of western music, basically focusing on the period from early renaissance to the romanticism. During the modal-tonal period, the prohibition of sequences of fifths and octaves was a compositional detail which, imposed as a norm compulsory application, conditioned the sound of western music with independence of the different styles that have been happening throughout these centuries. For this reason, this compositional aspect can be studied as a detail of a compositional practice with a few common foundations cultivated during some four hundred years. However, although the composers were present this rule, all of them performed, occasionally, this type of intervallic successions. This thesis presents a research and classification of this type of successions or typologies circumscribed, therefore, in the era of prohibition and, at the same time, of its practical implementation, analyzing the musical reasons that determine its use. The classification made established 17 categories, each of which brings together the different typologies that have a certain characteristic in common. Based on the different procedures used by composers, a total of 78 consecutive fifths and octaves typologies have been defined. In order to understand the reasons for the realization of some of these typologies, has carried out a study of acoustic and psychoacoustic. Thus, from a scientific point of view, can be understood in a more objective manner the reason of his practice. A suitable large number of works has been analysed since the temporary period studied is very extensive. Thus, the amount of analyzed compositions implies a significant enough sample in order to justify the results. Although thesis includes 927 examples of 188 composers, this selection has been made of the carried out analysis of some 6.100 works corresponding to 343 composers. There has been a search for numerous treaties of harmony and counterpoint to complete the presentation of the different typologies, as well as the chapter that deals with the reason of the prohibition, including opinions of various theorists. References to over two hundred treaties found have been exposed in the bibliography as useful reference. This research includes two extensions. On the one hand, the study of the main aesthetic emerged from the second half of the nineteenth century, presenting examples of consecutive fifths of different aesthetic works, and analyzing new compositional resources that facilitate this practice. On the other hand, includes a study of the influences that traditional music has had on the employment of this type of intervallic successions.},
