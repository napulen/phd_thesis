I will first and foremost thank my PhD advisor, Ichiro Fujinaga.
During my PhD, I found myself diverging and wandering with no clear direction once every while.
Ichiro scheduled weekly meetings with me for the most part of my PhD that served as my anchor. 
Together, we walked through machine-learning prototypes, presentations, code, music theories, and papers. 
Research aside, Ichiro has been a very supportive friend since I moved to Montr\'eal. 
He cared about my spouse's and my general health and wellbeing, and for that I am very grateful. 
Thank you, Ich.

Secondly, I would like to thank my family, who have supported me all along the journey of pursuing my dreams: my spouse and best friend, Kinga; my parents, Martha and Eduardo; my siblings, Grecia, Eric, and sister-in-law Fabiola; and my parents in law, Gra\.zyna and Miros\l{}aw.

Studying in Montr\'eal was a very pleasant experience for me, mostly due to the extraordinary people I met at the DDMAL lab and Music Technology Area at McGill.
Particularly, thanks to Gabriel Vigliensoni, Martha Thomae, Matan Gover, Alex Daigle, Yaolong Ju, Tim de Reuse, Emily Hopkins, Yulia Draginda, Laurent Feisthauer, Sylvain Margot, Jacob Sanz-Robinson, K\'e Zhang, Claire Arthur, Finn Upham, Jorge Calvo Zaragoza, and others with whom I shared great conversations and laughs.

Thanks to McGill professors Julie Cumming, Peter Schubert, William Caplin, Jon Wild, Philippe Depalle, Marcelo Wanderley, and Gary Scavone, from whom I learned different aspects of music and technology that eventually lead to the work presented in this dissertation.

Thanks to other members of the music information retrieval and computational musicology community, particularly, Mark Gotham, Craig Sapp, Michael Scott Cuthbert, Jacob Tyler Walls, Reinier de Valk, Emilia Parada-Cabaleiro, Helena Cuesta, and others with whom I shared code, papers, and points of view. 
% Without some of your contributions (e.g., music21 and humdrum), this thesis would not be possible. 
% Thank you for what you have given to the community!

This research would not have been possible without the generous support of FRQSC, SSHRC, CIRMMT, the Schulich School of Music, and the SIMSSA project. Thank you to all these wonderful institutions and their commitment to music research.

A special place for people who have made a mark in my life: Dr. Luis Alberto Casillas Santill\'an, MSc. Abelardo Guti\'errez, Juan Jos\'e L\'opez Sandoval, Nancy Arana Daniel, Sergio Bola\~nos, Leo Hendrik Reyes, and Juan Rodrigo P\'erez C\'ardenas.

Lastly, my friends, for being always there, especially in the darkest of times: Jhonnatan Razo, Dulce Alcal\'a, and El\'i Lezama. Â¡Gracias, amigos!
