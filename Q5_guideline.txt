Musicological questions about key
    What is the distribution of keys in all music from X composer?
    Does that distribution deviate from other composers of the same period?
    How has that changed in today's music?
    How useful is key as a feature for music classification?
    Does the density of local keys has changed in romantic music compared to baroque?
    How can we determine a modulation computationally?
