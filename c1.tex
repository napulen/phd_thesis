\section{Goal}

The main objective of this dissertation is to propose improvements over the existing methods for automatic tonal analysis, tailored around the \emph{common-practice} period of Western music. 

In recent years, improvement has been observed using multi-task learning (MTL) workflows for tonal analysis.
This research extends over that, proposing additional ways of doing data augmentation, and strengthening the shared representations of MTL approaches with additional tonal tasks.

\section{Motivation}

\guide{Why did people invent harmony theories and counterpoint theories.}
Throughout the history of Western tonal music, different theories explaining the organization of the sounds have been presented.
Music is a multi-dimensional phenomenon.
Multiple melodic streams, multiple timbres, and multiple rhythmic patterns in synergy.
It may be argued that these theories were introduced in order to train new composers.
It may also be argued that these theories were introduced to understand how previous composers thought about music.
To disentangle the patterns in the music of previous composers.
To understand how music ``works''.
To simplify the perceptual organization of simultaneous notes into a set of rules that could be easily understood.
In any case, many theories have emerged over the years.
One of the meta-theories we use nowadays, in Western tonal music, is Roman numeral analysis.
An analytical tool, in principle, Roman numeral analysis is useful as a framework for a theorist or musician to describe the harmonic context of the music.
This is necessary as more complex tonal relationships (e.g., modulations) are introduced in the music composition process.
When moving to the digital domain, we can still think of this framework as an analytical tool that allows us to understand music in a simpler way.
A summary of the harmonic context.
My motivation with this dissertation is to connect the theories that have evolved over the years, with the ruthless and methodological outputs of computer algorithms.


Automatic Chord Recognition (ACR) has been explored thoroughly in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). 
ACR systems typically seek to predict the root and quality of the chords throughout a piece of music via either an audio or a symbolic representation.
A more specific type of chordal analysis, particularly relevant for Western classical music, is functional harmony, or Roman numeral analysis. 
The main difference between ACR and functional harmony is that the latter requires other adjacent tasks to be solved simultaneously, notably including detection and identification of key changes (modulations \cite{feisthauer_estimating_2020, schreiber_local_2020} and tonicizations \cite{napoles_lopez_local_2020}).

% Partly due to the repertoires typically targeted, Roman numeral analysis also involves handling of some additional `special chords' such as Neapolitan and Augmented sixth chords.

\guide{Roman Numeral Analysis.}
The analytical process of functional harmony is commonly described through Roman numeral annotations. 
This annotation system is particularly popular in Western music theory for the analysis of `common-practice' tonal music.
Roman numeral annotations encode a great deal of information about tonality, in a compact syntax.
For instance, an annotation like  \texttt{C:viio65/V} includes an account of the local key (here C), the quality of the chord (diminished seventh), the chord inversion (first), and nature of any tonicization (optional, here true: of the dominant). 

\guide{Problem.}
From a computational perspective, predicting such annotations is challenging given that the model has to predict multiple features correctly and simultaneously. 
In the past, MIR researchers have reconstructed Roman numeral annotations by predicting six sub-tasks: chord quality, chord root, local key, inversion, primary degree, and secondary degree \cite{chen_functional_2018, micchi_not_2020}. 
%
Thus, as a machine learning problem, functional harmony can be expressed as the task of correctly predicting enough features in order to reconstruct the original Roman numeral label. 

% I would cut this duplication of the above: In spite of their compactness, Roman numeral strings are sufficient to provide all of these features, and thus show to be convenient as an annotation system for creating functional harmony datasets.

Recent efforts in this area have seen a great standardization of the notation and conversion routines, \cite{gotham_romantext_2019} which in turn has facilitated the amassing of a relatively large meta-corpus of Roman numeral analyses \cite{gotham_romantext_2019}.
However, despite these developments and the wider resurgence of interest in the field, the performance of functional harmony models for predicting full Roman numeral labels remains relatively low.

\guide{Solution.}
In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture that improves the prediction of functional harmony and its relevant features. 
Beside the architecture itself, our model benefits from increased data augmentation (beyond key transpositions), and an additional set of output tasks that enhance the effects of multi-task learning demonstrated by other researchers \cite{chen_functional_2018}.

To facilitate the work of other researchers, we release all of our preprocessed datasets, data splits, experiment logs, and the full source code of our network in [ANONYMIZED], under a permissive MIT license.
