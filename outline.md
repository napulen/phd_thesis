What is a modulation? An approach from computational music theory.

Introduction
	Music theories should be supported by proof (data).
    Music theories should comply the basic scrutiny that we hold for all science.
    This is possible nowadays thanks to computational methods, that allow us to scrutinize large amounts of data that would be impossible for human analysts.
    Hence, this work is a bridge between music theory and computer science.

    A word on "music theories" and "rules"
        There is no "true" modulation theory, as there is no true "harmony" or "counterpoint" theory.
        There is only a better theory than the best-known theory.
        A better theory generalizes better than the best-known theory to date.
        Many ideas taken as a baseline for this dissertation are the best-known theories in modulation and harmony, which have been adopted by many theorists, taught in college-level music curricula, and achieve good generalization (but imperfect) in common practice music.
        Examples of these theories and workflows include roman numeral analysis and Riemannian-theory
        Other theories (Schenkerian, GTTM) have not achieved widespread reach as to replace them in textbooks and other forms of music education

    Cognitive of tonality is elusive, culturally-dependent, and for the most part, an open research field. 
    It is expected that music cognition will help answering many questions about the topics discussed here, however, the knowledge in this area is far from replacing the theories that are taught to aspiring musicians, composers, theorists, and scholars.
    This work deals with two basic domains: music theory and data science.
    Cognitive theories of tonality are briefly discussed, but they are not at the core of this work.

Literature review
    History of modulation
        The origin of the term "modulation"
            When was the word "modulation" introduced?
                (Peter Schubert said that the word was really old, I expect to find explicit references in the renaissance to what "modulation" meant back then)
            What is a modulation?
                (Introduce the change of meaning here)
            When was the word "modulation" used to denote a "change of key" for the first time?
                (Probably around the late eighteenth century, as I found out explicit references recently)
            How has the meaning of the word "modulation" changed over time?
                Structural definitions (i.e., PAC, change of key signature, etc.)
                Distributional definitions (i.e., length of change of key, keyscapes, etc.)  

        The origin of the term "tonicization"
            When was the word "tonicization" first introduced?
            What is a tonicization?

        The origin of the term "secondary dominant"
            When was the term "secondary dominant" first introduced?
            Is it the same that a "tonicization"?        

        The origin of the term "applied chord/secondary chord"
            When was the term "applied chord" first introduced?
            Is it the same that a "tonicization"?

        The origin of the term "modal mixture/modal borrowing"
            When was the term "modal mixture" first introduced?
            Is it the same that a "tonicization"?

        The origin of the term "local key"
            When was the term "local key" first introduced?
            How does it relate to modulation and tonicization?
