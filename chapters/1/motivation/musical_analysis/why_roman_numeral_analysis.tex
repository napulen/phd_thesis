% This is \refsubsubsec{whyromannumeralanalysis}, which
% introduces the why roman numeral analysis.

Roman numeral analysis is a common methodology to learn and
teach harmonic analysis in music theory lessons. The
notation has evolved from the early nineteenth century to
the one we use today. One reason I think it is still
prominent in music theory, is because it compresses
information of both chordal and tonal (key) analysis. The
notation is compact, but filled with information that an
analyst can unpack in different ways.
