% This is \refsec{motivation}, which introduces the
% motivation.

One of the most common ways to analyze a piece of tonal
music is through Roman numeral analysis. This requires the
inspection of several attributes related to chords and keys.
I want to start by exploring the motivation behind musical
analysis. That is, why would someone be interested in
analyzing music? Furthermore, why would someone be
interested in designing a computational model that analyzes
music automatically?

I present my thoughts on general musical analysis in \refsubsec{musicalanalysis}, and some motivations for computational analysis in \refsubsect{computationalmusicalanalysis}.
