This dissertation is organized in seven chapters and an
appendix. \refchap{introduction} described the motivations,
challenges, and existing progress toward \gls{arna}.
\refchap{introductiontoromannumeralanalysis} introduces
\gls{rna} from a musical perspective, its history and
digitization. \refchap{background} introduces the relevant
research around music representation, deep learning,
\gls{mir} for tonal music analysis.
\refchap{dataacquisitionandpreparation} introduces the
datasets and \gls{mlops} employed to train the glspl{rna}
model presented in this thesis. \refchap{modeldesign}
presents the design choices of the convolutional recurrent
neural network: number of layers, multitask configuration,
input and output representations, etc.
\refchap{experimentalevaluation} presents the evaluation of
the model against the state-of-the-art in \gls{arna}.
\refchap{conclusions} summarizes the main findings and
presents closing remarks on the current state of automatic
tonal analysis and future directions in the field.
