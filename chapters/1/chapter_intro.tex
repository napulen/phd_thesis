This \thesisdiss{} deals with the methods for automatically
annotating a musical score with Roman numeral analysis
labels. Among other applications, this facilitates advanced
searching workflows in music collections. For example,
searching by chord progressions or by modulation
trajectories.

In \refsec{motivation}, I present my personal motivation to
contribute to this problem. \refsec{challenges} introduces
the main challenges of this problem, as well as existing
progress. \refsec{outlineofthesiscontributions} presents the
contributions of this \thesisdiss{}. Finally,
\refsec{thesisstructure} presents the structure of the
remaining chapters.
