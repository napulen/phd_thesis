One of the most common ways to analyze a piece of tonal
music is through \gls{rna}. This requires the inspection of
several attributes related to chords and keys. For example,
the inversion of a chord, its root, and whether it tonicizes
a momentary musical key. Clearly, if a \gls{rna} is computed
automatically, these tonal attributes become automatically
available too. However, the Roman numeral notation itself
also describes complex---sometimes exotic---chords,
fluctuations of musical key, and other tonal situations in a
very compact syntax. This is maybe the reason why a number
of musicians have preferred it throughout the years. It is a
notation that is compact enough to be annotated within a
regular musical score, yet encodes explanations to advanced
musical concepts that would require much more words and
effort to be described otherwise.
