% This is
% \refsubsec{alternativewaystoreconstructromannumerallabels},
% which introduces the alternative ways to reconstruct roman
% numeral labels.

In the work by \textcite{chen2018functional}, Roman numeral
labels were divided into a subset of classification tasks,
from which the full Roman numeral label was predicted. In
this \thesisdiss{}, I propose an alternative combination of
tonal tasks that can be used to reconstruct the Roman
numeral label. This alternative method results in a higher
accuracy.
