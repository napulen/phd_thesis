In the work by \textcite{chen2018functional}, Roman numeral
labels were divided into a subset of classification tasks,
from which the full Roman numeral label was predicted.
However, the process for turning the \gls{mtl} predictions
of the network into labels was not described. This process
is far from trivial. In this \thesisdiss{}, I propose two
methods to process the predictions of an \gls{arna} model
and turn them into \gls{rna} annotations as strings of text.
One of the methods is tailored for the specific \gls{crnn}
described in this dissertation (see
\refsubsec{directmethod}), however, another method is more
generic and can facilitate the process of retrieving
\gls{rna} annotations in other models (see
\refsubsec{indirectmethod}).
