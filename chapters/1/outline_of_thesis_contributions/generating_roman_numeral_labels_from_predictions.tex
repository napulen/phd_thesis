In the work by \textcite{chen2018functional}, Roman numeral
labels were divided into a subset of classification tasks,
from which the full Roman numeral label was predicted.
However, the process for turning the \gls{mtl} predictions
of the network into \gls{rna} labels was not described. This
process is far from trivial. In this \thesisdiss{}, I
propose two methods to process the predictions of an
\gls{arna} model and turn them into \gls{rna} annotations in
text form. One of the methods is tailored for the specific
\gls{crnn} described in this dissertation (see
\refsubsec{directmethod}). Yet, another method is more
generic and can facilitate the process of retrieving
\gls{rna} annotations from other models of the literature
(see \refsubsec{indirectmethod}).
