% This is \refsubsec{additionaltonaltasks}, which introduces
% the additional tonal tasks.

An important aspect of Roman numeral analysis is that it is
more closely related to a grammar than it is related to a
vocabulary of classes. Because of this, they are difficult
to understand. However, they implicitly encode an extensive
amount of information about the tonal context. An idea
proposed in this \thesisdiss is to create different tonal
classification problems froma single Roman numeral analysis
label. Although this has been done already, for example, by
\textcite{chen2018functional}, we propose an additional
number of this classification problems to be included in the
neural network architecture.
