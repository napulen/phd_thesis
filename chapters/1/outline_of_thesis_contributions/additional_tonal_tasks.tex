An important aspect of \gls{rna} is that it may span an
incredibly large vocabulary of chords, with special symbols
(e.g., $\rnN$ or $\rnGer$) acting in special context, such
as modulations and tonicizations. Because of this, chords in
\gls{rna} are difficult to understand. However, they
implicitly encode an extensive amount of information about
the tonal context. An idea proposed in this \thesisdiss{} is
to create different tonal classification problems from a
single \gls{rna} label. Although this has been done already,
for example, by \textcite{chen2018functional}, this
dissertation presents a different set of these
classification problems to be included in the neural network
architecture. These are discussed in
\refsec{multitasklearningoutputs}.
