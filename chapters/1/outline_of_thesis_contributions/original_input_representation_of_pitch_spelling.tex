Extending over the work of \textcite{micchi2020not}, in this
\thesisdiss{}, I present an alternative encoding method for
pitch spelling. This method provides similar benefits than
the one in \textcite{micchi2020not}, but it requires less
parameters in the neural network architecture. Particularly,
this new encoding method is used in the input
representations of the network, described in
\refsubsec{encodingthescore}.
