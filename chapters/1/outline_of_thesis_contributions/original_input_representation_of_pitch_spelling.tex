% This is
% \refsubsec{originalinputrepresentationofpitchspelling},
% which introduces the original input representation of
% pitch spelling.

Extending over the work of \textcite{micchi2020not}, in this \thesisdiss, I present a new representation of pitch spelling. This representation provides similar benefits than the one by \textcite{micchi2020not}, but it requires less parameters in the neural network architecture.
