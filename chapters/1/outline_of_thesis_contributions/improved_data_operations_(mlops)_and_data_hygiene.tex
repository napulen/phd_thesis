% which introduces the improved data operations (mlops) and
% data hygiene.

In recent years, machine learning researchers have become
aware of the critical role that data plays in any
experiment. For example, making sure that the quality or
``hygiene'' of the data employed in an experiment meets a
certain quality. This effort frequently takes most of the
time in a machine learning project. The idea of improving
the data workflows has received the name of machine learning
operations (MLOps). A description of some MLOps principles
is provided by \textcite{renggli2021data}.

There are at least four different digital standards of Roman
numeral annotations. The available data is encoded with
these different formats. Thus, it is challenging to
aggregate the data into a unified training dataset, often
leading to noisy and inaccurate training examples.
Throughout this \thesisdiss, I propose a few methodologies
to operate with the existing data.

These methodologies include, for example, the development of
\emph{unit tests} to validate the quality of the annotations
across datasets, the development of quantitative metrics to spot ``incorrect'' annotations, and so on. These methodologies are discussed more in depth in \refchap{modeldesign}.
