% This is \refsubsec{artificialtrainingexamples},
% which introduces the artificial training examples.

One way to overcome the scarcity of data is by synthesizing artificial training examples from existing data. This technique is popular in computer vision, where labeled images are transformed in different ways (e.g., rotation, mirroring, skewing, changing the brightness, etc.) I propose a new strategy to generate new training examples from existing Roman numeral annotations.
