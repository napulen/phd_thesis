In some contexts such as guitar tablatures
\cite{ultimateguitar} and electronic dance music
\cite{beatport}, global-key annotations are useful as one of
the search parameters of a digital music library. Local-key
annotations, however, have not yet been used for this
purpose. It would be useful to complement key-related
searches with local-key annotations, using them to search
for musical pieces, based on their underlying changes of
key. As modulation are powerful tools to change the mood of
a score, indexing local keys within the score could help the
musicologist make bridges between lyrics and the tonal path.
However, the ``interpretability'' of local-key annotations
requires some attention first.
