% This is \refsubsubsec{datascarcity}, which introduces the
% data scarcity.

For the same reasons discussed in
\refsubsubsec{time-consumingannotations}, the scarcity of
high-quality data remains an important challenge in
\gls{arna}. In this dissertation, a large \gls{rna} dataset
has been aggregated from publicly available annotations (see
\refsec{publiclyavailabledatasets}). Although this comprises
an extensive amount of \gls{rna} annotations, it remains
relatively small for the scope of deep learning projects.
