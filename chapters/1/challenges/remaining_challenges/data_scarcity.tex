% This is \refsubsubsec{datascarcity}, which introduces the
% data scarcity.

For the same reasons discussed in
\refsubsubsec{scarcityofdata}, the scarcity of high-quality
data remains an important challenge in \gls{arna}. In this
dissertation, a large \gls{rna} dataset has been aggregated
from publicly available annotations (see
\refsec{publiclyavailabledatasets}). Although this comprises
an extensive amount of annotations, it remains relatively
small for the scope of deep learning research.
