% This is \refsubsubsec{segmentation},
% which introduces the segmentation.

In their subsequent work, \textcite{chen2019harmony,chen2021attend} introduced the use of Transformer-based networks \parencite{vaswani2017attention} to improve the segmentation of the annotations. Segmentation refers to the location where a Roman numeral label ends and the new one begins. This has also become a priority in the work of \textcite{micchi2021deep} and remains a relevant challenge.
