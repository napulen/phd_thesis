% This is \refsubsubsec{segmentation}, which introduces the
% segmentation.

Predicting the location of chords (i.e., the harmonic
rhythm) is a difficult problem. In their subsequent work on
\gls{arna}, \textcite{chen2019harmony,chen2021attend}
introduced the use of Transformer-based networks
\parencite{vaswani2017attention} to improve the segmentation
of the annotations. The segmentation refers to the location
where a Roman numeral label ends and the new one begins.
This has also become a priority in the work of
\textcite{micchi2021deep} and remains a relevant challenge.
This problem not only affects analytical models but
generative ones too, requiring \textcite{wu2021melody} to
develop an independent model of harmonic rhythm for melody
harmonization. The work in this dissertation also considers
ways to tackle this problem (see
\refsubsec{HarmonicRhythm7}).
