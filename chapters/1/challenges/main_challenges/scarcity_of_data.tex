% This is \refsubsubsec{scarcityofdata}, which introduces
% the scarcity of data.

Compared to other machine learning tasks, there is not as
much high-quality data available for training Roman numeral
analysis models. In order to illustrate some of the reasons
why this is the case, I contrast the process of annotating
data for the well-known MNIST dataset
\parencite{lecun1989handwritten} against Roman numeral analysis.

\phdtwofigures[MNIST annotations][Roman numeral annotations][0.3][0.7]{mnist}{chords}

\reffig{mnist} shows a grid of nine handwritten digits,
which could be labeled to create training examples for the MNIST dataset.
\reffig{chords} shows a chord progression with nine chords.
Each of the chords can be labeled with a Roman numeral
annotation to create training examples for a Roman numeral analysis dataset. It can be noted
that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The handwritten digits can be labeled by a wider
    range of annotators, whereas the chords require an annotator with expertise on tonal harmony
    \item Even for an annotator with expertise on tonal harmony, the handwritten digits take much less time to annotate than the chords\footnote{As an informal test, I timed myself annotating the nine labels of each figure the first time I saw them. I spent, roughly, 10 seconds annotating the handwritten digits and 75 seconds annotating the Roman numeral labels. That is, annotating the chords was 7.5 longer for me than annotating the handwritten digits.}
\end{enumerate}

In conjunction, these problems, make high-quality Roman numeral analysis data expensive and scarce.
