\phdtwofigures[MNIST annotations][Roman numeral annotations][0.3][0.7]{mnist}{chords}

\reffig{mnist} shows a grid of nine handwritten digits,
which could be labeled to create a training examples.
\reffig{chords} shows a chord progression with nine chords.
Each of the chords can be labeled with a Roman numeral
annotation to create training examples. It can be noted
that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The handwritten digits can be labeled by a wider range of annotators, whereas the chords require an expert annotator of harmony
    \item The handwritten digits take less time to annotate than the chords
\end{enumerate}
