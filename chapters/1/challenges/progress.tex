% This is \refsubsec{progress}, which introduces the
% progress.

Recent years have seen significant progress and interest
from the \gls{mir} community in \gls{arna}. For example,
pioneering approaches were spaced for up to decades
\parencite{winograd1968linguistics, maxwell1984artificial,
temperley1997algorithm}, whereas the last year saw at least
four new \gls{arna} approaches \parencite{chen2021attend,
micchi2021deep, mcleod2021modular,
napoleslopez2021augmentednet}. These approaches have
introduced new ideas and methods to tackle \gls{arna}.
