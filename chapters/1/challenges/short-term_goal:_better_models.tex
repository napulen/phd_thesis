% This is \refsubsec{short-termgoal:bettermodels}, which
% introduces the short-term goal: better models.

In the past few years, deep learning models have achieved
significant improvements. This has been possible because
new, more powerful, deep learning techniques have been
introduced. Similarly, the libraries for prototyping
experiments, such as Tensorflow or Pytorch, have become much
more stable and robust. Thus, it is not surprising to think
that in the next years, the performance of \glspl{rna}
models will only improve from the models we have today.
Although expensive, new datasets are created at an
increasing pace. The short-term goal around this problem is,
necessarily, to increase the accuracy and performance that
these models achieve.
