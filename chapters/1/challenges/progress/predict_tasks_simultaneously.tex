For the first time in automtic Roman numeral analysis,
\textcite{chen2018functional} approached the problem using
deep neural networks. An important finding in their experiments was that multitask learning \cite{ruder2017overview} provided better results when predicting Roman numeral labels. That is, the different \emph{satellite} tasks of Roman numeral analysis: key estimation, chord recognition, are best modeled together, sharing the same neural network weights. This has shown others a new paradigm to approach this problem.
