% This is \refsubsubsec{predicttaskssimultaneously}, which
% introduces the predict tasks simultaneously.

For the first time in \gls{arna},
\textcite{chen2018functional} approached the problem using
deep neural networks. An important finding in their
experiments was that multitask learning\footnote{A good
summary of multitask learning is presented by
\textcite{ruder2017overview}.} provided better results when
predicting Roman numeral labels. That is, the intrinsic
tasks of \gls{arna}, key estimation and chord recognition,
are best modeled together, sharing the same neural network
weights. This has shown others a new paradigm to approach
this problem. Nevertheless, this approach is continued to be
challenged, for example, with modular approaches that
separate the tasks and tackle them in a dedicated way
\parencite{mcleod2021modular}.
