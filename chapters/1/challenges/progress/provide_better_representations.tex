After \textcite{chen2018functional}, subsequent work by
\textcite{micchi2020not} considered different input
representations of the musical input consumed by the
automatic Roman numeral analysis model. What they found is
that providing information about the lowest sounding note
and the pitch classes is generally better than a full
pianoroll input, and results in a smaller neural network
too. Subsequent research (e.g., the one presented in this
\thesisdiss{}) confirms that this representation results in
more accurate predictions.
