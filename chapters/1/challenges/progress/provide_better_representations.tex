After \textcite{chen2018functional}, subsequent work by
\textcite{micchi2020not} considered different input
representations of the musical input delivered to the
\gls{arna} model. What they found is that providing
information about the lowest sounding note and the pitch
classes is generally better than a full pianoroll input, and
results in a smaller neural network too. Subsequent research
(e.g., the one presented in this \thesisdiss{}) confirms
that this representation results in more accurate
predictions.
