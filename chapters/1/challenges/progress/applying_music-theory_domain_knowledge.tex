% This is
% \refsubsubsec{applyingmusic-theorydomainknowledge}, which
% introduces the applying music-theory domain knowledge.

In their work, \textcite{micchi2020not} also demonstrated
how the use of music-theory domain knowledge benefits the
design of \glspl{rna} models.
Particularly, two ideas inspired by music theory included
the consideration of pitch spelling in the
model\footnote{Taking pitch spelling into account means that
two enharmonic pitch classes are different classes, such
that $C\sharp \neq D\flat$, when the convention in most \gls{mir}
research is that $C\sharp = D\flat$.} and taking modulations
into account when transposing music for data augmentation.
