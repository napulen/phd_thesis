% main challenges.

Among the challenges that could come up when tackling
\gls{arna} as an \gls{mir} problem, I identify three that
are impactful in most \gls{arna} approaches I have seen: (1)
it is difficult to draw a clear line separating different
tonal problems (i.e., tonal problems like \gls{acr} and key
estimation overlap), (2) annotations in chordal and key
analysis are ambiguous, and (3) there's a scarcity of
high-quality data.
