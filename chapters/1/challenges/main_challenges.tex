Among the many challenges that could emerge within automatic
Roman numeral analysis, I identify three that are impactful
in every automatic Roman numeral analysis approach: (1) it is difficult to draw a clear line separating
different tonal problems (i.e., tonal problems like automatic chord recognition and key estimation overlap), (2)
annotations in chordal and key analysis are ambiguous, and (3) there's a scarcity of high-quality data.
