% main challenges.

Among the many challenges that could emerge within automatic
Roman numeral analysis, I identify three that are
potentially impactful in every automatic Roman numeral
analysis approach. The fact that it is difficult to draw a
clear line separating different tonal problems (i.e., they
overlap), the fact that annotations in chordal and key
analysis are ambiguous, and the fact that there's a scarcity
of high-quality data.
