The end-to-end system presented in this dissertation has
been implemented as a software project in the Python
programming language \parencite{vanrossum2007python}. The
code is publicly available on GitHub and it has been
thoroughly version controlled and tested. The project's
repository informally started in November 2020 and went
through continuous revisions until the version presented in
this dissertation.

\refsubsec{releases} documents the releases of the project
since 2020. These changes are often related to bug fixes,
unit tests, and general software implementation. However,
they also refer to the implementation of intellectual
contributions highlighted in this dissertation. For example,
\code{v1.6.0} introduced the \gls{duration14} representation
discussed in \refsubsubsec{measureandnoteonsets}.
