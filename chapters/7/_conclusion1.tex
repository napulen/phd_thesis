We present advances in the use of convolutional recurrent
neural networks to predict Roman numeral labels. In
Beethoven Piano Sonatas (BPS) and the Well-Tempered Clavier
(WTC) datasets, our network outperforms existing models in
the prediction of the conventional tonal tasks and the
reconstruction of the Roman numeral labels. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the use of an additional task,
RomanNumeral75, is helpful to achieve better results in the
final reconstruction step, compared to using the six
conventional tasks proposed by previous researchers.
