This dissertation described the two-year effort of N\'estor
N\'apoles L\'opez tackling \glspl{rna}, with the aid of the
many-year effort of understanding music, music theory, music
encoding, and computer science. The main contribution of the
report is the journey, documented by software revisions. If
this dissertation was written six months from now, the
system would likely look different. That is, there is much
to do, many experiments to try, and a lot of ideas worth
implementing. Hopefully, the work presented here will be of
help to future researchers tackling this and similar
problems by illustrating some of the findings and insights
learned. In a not-too-long future, I foresee these systems
being used widely in music education. In general, I think of
such a system as a ``music theory'' calculator. They will
not replace the role of music theorists, but they will
automate the ``easy'' tasks of music theory, like labelling
clear unambiguous chords.
