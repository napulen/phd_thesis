A pretrained model of the system is distributed to the
public. This model is the one trained for the comparison
experiments against previous methods. That is, the
best-performing version of the model. It can be used to
annotate unseen \gls{musicxml} scores, or to compare the
predictions of a newer model against the one presented here.

The pretrained model was written using the \emph{Tensorflow}
and \emph{Keras} libraries \parencite{abadi2016tensorflow,
chollet2021deep}. It is distributed in the \gls{hdf5} format
with the rest of the source
code.\footnotelink{https://github.com/napulen/AugmentedNet}
