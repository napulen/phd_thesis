A pretrained model of the system is distributed to the
public. This model is the one trained for the comparison
experiments against previous methods. That is, the
best-performing version of the model. It can be used to
annotate unseen \gls{musicxml} scores, or to compare the
predictions of a newer model against the one presented here.
