Throughout the development of the end-to-end system, the
experiments were documented with the \emph{MLFlow}
\textcite{zaharia2018accelerating} Python library. Among
other things, the software facilitates the recording of the
\code{git} commit (i.e., version of the source code), the
name identifiers of the experiment, and the evaluation
scores achieved during the experiment. The logs for each of
the experiments reported in the dissertation are shared in
their original \emph{MLFlow} format (i.e., as an
\code{mlruns} folder). One drawback is that the software
requires some experience setting up a local development
environment to visualize the results. Thus, as an additional
convenience, the logs per training epoch of each experiment
have also been uploaded to the
\code{Tensorboard.dev}
platform,\footnotelink{https://tensorboard.dev/} which is
freely available at the time of writing.
