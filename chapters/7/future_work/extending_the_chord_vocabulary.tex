The chord vocabulary proposed in this dissertation consists
of 121 \gls{pcset}s (see
\refsec{thevocabularyofpitch-classsets}) and 31 classes of
Roman numeral ``numerators'' (see
\refsec{thevocabularyofromannumeralnumerators}). This
vocabulary is more extensive than most recent approaches,
but still neglects several chords that are used in practice.
For example, it did not consider
\emph{common-tone diminished seventh chords}
($\rn{CT}\rndim{}\rn{7}$), \emph{minor-major seventh
chords}, nor suspended chords of any kind.
\reffig{extending_vocabulary} shows an example of such
chords, which are left for future work.

existing vocabulary: common-tone diminished seventh chords,
major-minor seventh chords, and suspended chords,
