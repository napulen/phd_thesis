The chord vocabulary proposed in this dissertation consists
of 121 pitch class sets and 31 classes of Roman numeral
``numerators''. This vocabulary is more extensive than most
recent approaches, but still neglects several chords that
are used in practice. For example, it did not consider
\emph{common-tone diminished seventh chords}
($\rn{CT}\rndim{}\rn{7}$), \emph{minor-major seventh
chords}, nor suspended chords of any kind.
\reffig{newchords} shows an example of such chords, which
are left for future work.

proposed vocabulary: a common-tone diminished seventh,
major-minor seventh, and suspended chord,
respectively]{newchords}
