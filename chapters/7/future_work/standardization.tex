Annotating musical scores with \gls{rna} annotations
continues to be, fortunately and unfortunately, an
idiosyncratic process. The digitization standards presented
in \refsubsec{digitalstandards} will continue to exist and
update. New standards are expected to be introduced, and
researchers will continue to prioritize different goals in
their analytical work. For this reason, I consider that
standardization will continue to be a challenge in this
research. Nevertheless, as the tools mature, hopefully the
compatibility and portability of different points of view
will require less manual work. Some of the existing points
of friction that I consider deserve more attention are the
distinction between modulations and tonicizations, and the
consistency in chord annotations (e.g., the conventions for
inversions in certain chords).
