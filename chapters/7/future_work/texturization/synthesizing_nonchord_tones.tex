An approach that was not explored in the texturization
techniques proposed here was the use of nonchord tones. In
all the texturization examples, the notes remain as
exclusively chord tones. This is not, however, the case for
most ``real'' music examples, as they quite often introduce
passing notes, neighbouring notes, and other forms of
nonchord tones. The use of synthetic nonchord tones was
avoided because it naturally introduces additional problems,
but these could be overcome and result beneficial to the
quality of the data augmentation examples.
