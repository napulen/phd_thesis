An approach that was not explored in the texturization
techniques proposed here was the use of \gls{nonchord}s. In
all the texturization examples, the notes were exclusively
chord tones. This is not, however, the case for most
``real'' music, as they quite often introduce passing notes,
neighbouring notes, and other forms of \gls{nonchord}s. The
use of synthetic \gls{nonchord}s was avoided because it
naturally introduces additional problems, but these could be
overcome and result beneficial to the quality of the
data-augmentation examples.
