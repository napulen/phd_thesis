Recent work on generative deep learning models has shown
latent representations that capture texture, such as the one
by \textcite{wang2020learning}. It would be interesting to
apply these models to the texturization strategies used for
\gls{rna} models. Another option would be to obtain common
texturization patterns from existing music, rather than
designing them with heuristics, as it was done here.
