Recent work on generative deep learning models has shown
latent representations that capture texture, such as the one
by \textcite{wang2020learning}. It would be interesting to
apply these models to the texturization strategies used for
\gls{rna} models. Another, maybe simpler option, would be to
obtain common texturization patterns from existing music,
rather than designing them from heuristics.
