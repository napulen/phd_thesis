The annotations generated by existing \gls{arna} models are
not generally sonified. However, this can be solved in
various ways. One such way is to create a voice-leading
algorithm that receives \gls{rna} inputs and generates a
four-part harmonization of the annotations. This could help
to, for example, produce the automatic harmonic reduction of
a musical score analyzed by a \gls{arna} model.
