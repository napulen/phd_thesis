During the last year of my doctoral program, I participated
in a research internship as part of the Mitacs
organization.\footnotelink{https://www.mitacs.ca/en/projects/deep-learning-automatic-melody-harmonization}
In this project, I developed a generative algorithm to
propose harmonizations to a given melody. Although the
algorithm developed was of a generative nature, the core
technology behind it was the proposed model in this
dissertation. \reffig{melody_harmonization} shows an example
of this application. Other research directions at the
intersection of analysis and generation could be explored.

\phdfigure[A generative system that suggests chord
accompaniments for a given melody. The input prompt to the
system is the upper staff. The system returns the labels of
the lower staff, which are automatically realized into the
chords shown in the lower staff]{melody_harmonization}
