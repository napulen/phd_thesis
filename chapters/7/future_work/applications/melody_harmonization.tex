During the last year of my doctoral program, I participated
in a research internship as part of the Mitacs organization.
In this project, I developed a generative algorithm to
propose harmonizations to a given melody. Although the
algorithm developed was of a generative nature, the core
technology behind it was the proposed model in this
dissertation. Other research directions at the intersection
of analysis and generation could be explored.
