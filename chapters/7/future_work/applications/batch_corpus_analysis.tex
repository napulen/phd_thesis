The proposed algorithm could be used to annotate batches of
scores automatically for different purposes. For example,
annotating all of the Bach Chorales requires approximately
\missing{exact computation time} using the proposed system.
In the past, human-in-the-loop methods have been proposed,
where an expert annotator corrects a set of auto-generated
annotations to reduce the time required to annotate a
dataset. Using an existing model to batch annotate scores
could be a way of producing more trainin data for future
models.
