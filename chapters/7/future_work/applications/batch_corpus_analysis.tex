The pretrained end-to-end model described in
\refsubsec{pretrainedmodel} could be used to annotate
batches of scores automatically for different purposes. For
example, annotating all of the Bach Chorales requires
approximately \missing{exact computation time} using the
proposed system. In the past, human-in-the-loop methods like
the one by \textcite{ju2019interactive} have been proposed,
where an expert annotator corrects a set of auto-generated
annotations to reduce the time required to annotate a
dataset. Using an existing model to batch annotate scores
could be a way of producing more training data for future
models.
