The synthesis technique explored for data augmentation
relied on artificial texturization of the chords. The
proposed method made use of three simple texturization
patterns, described in \refsubsubsec{texturizationpatterns}.
However, there might be better ways to perform this
texturization, such as data-driven texturizaton patterns or
introducing texturizations with synthetic nonchord tones.
