The problem of having consistent labels of chords and
inversions is less intellectually profound than modulations
and tonicizations. Some researchers have different
conventions for the definitions of chords that result in
incompatibilities when aggregating datasets. For example,
the ``root'' of a French \gls{augsix}, or the label for a
so-called cadential six-four. Perhaps a conversation among
analysts and dataset curators could fix these problems one
day. They certainly take time away while performing
\gls{arna} research.
