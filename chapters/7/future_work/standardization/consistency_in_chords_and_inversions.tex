This problem is less intellectually profound than
modulations and tonicizations. Some researchers have
different conventions for the definitions of chords that
result in headaches for the person who is aggregating the
dataset. For example, the ``root'' of a French augmented
sixth, or the so-called cadential six-four. Perhaps a
conversation among analysts and dataset curators would fix
all of these problems in one day.
