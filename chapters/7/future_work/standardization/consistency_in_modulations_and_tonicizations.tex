In the work presented at \textcite{napoleslopez2020local},
we discussed the problem of a lack of definition of
modulations and tonicizations, which has implications for
\gls{mir} research. In that work, different harmony
textbooks featured different degrees of consistency in the
use of modulations and tonicizations. Considering that these
represented  easy ``textbook'' examples of modulations, it
is then logical to expect greater inconsistency in more
complicated corpora, such as the ones from this
dissertation. This is a difficult problem, but at the same
time fascinating phenomena of tonal music, the precipituous
fluctuation of musical keys, how they are perceived by the
human ear, and the way they are annotated in an analytical
framework like \gls{rna}. This venue of research probably
requires more involvement of the \gls{mpc} and music theory
communities. I am less hopeful that the \gls{mir} will
propose definite solutions to the problem.
