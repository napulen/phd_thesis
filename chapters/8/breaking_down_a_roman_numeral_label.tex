If we consider a Roman numeral label to be a
``fraction-like'' expression of the form

\begin{equation}
    \elkey : \elnum \: / \: \elden
\end{equation}

then the symbol $\elkey$ preceding the colon represents a
key, the numerator $\elnum$ represents a chord, and the
denominator $\elden$ represents a tonicized key. For
instance, in the annotation 

\begin{equation}
    \rn{C}:\rnviihosev{}/\rnV
\end{equation}

the preceding symbol $\elkey=\rn{C}$ indicates the key of
$\keyC$; the denominator $\elden = \rnV$ indicates a
tonicization of the dominant of key $\elkey$, $\keyG$; and
$\elnum=\rnviihosev$ indicates a chord of the tonicized key
$\elden$, an F$\musSharp$ half-diminished seventh chord.

The mode (major or minor) of the keys implied by $\elkey$
and $\elden$ is indicated by a case-sensitive notation. For
example, if the annotation was instead

\begin{equation}
    \rn{C}:\rnviiosev{}/\rnii
\end{equation}

the denominator $\elden=\rnii$ indicates a key of $\keyd$.
In this case, the numerator $\elnum = \rnviiosev$ indicates
a chord that is relative to the key $\elden$, namely, a
C$\musSharp$ diminished seventh chord.

Tonicizations are optional and do not occur often. If there
is no symbol $\elden$ in the annotation, it can be assumed
to be the same key as $\elkey$. For example, in the
annotation

\begin{equation}
    \rn{G}:\rnVsev
\end{equation}

$\elden = \elkey = \keyG$. The ``modulation'' key\footnote{I
like to refer to key $\elkey$ as the ``modulation'' key.
However, it is also common to refer to it as the ``local
key'' among the \gls{mir} literature
\parencite{napoleslopez2020local}} $\elkey$ is mandatory for
the numerator $\elnum$ to have any meaning, but it can be
omitted in subsequent annotations if it remains unchanged.
For example, in two subsequent \gls{rna} annotations

\begin{equation}
    \rn{G}:\rnVsev \;\;\;\; \rnI
\end{equation}

the symbols are $\elkey=\keyG$, $\elden=\keyG$, and
$\elnum=\rnVsev$, for the first annotation, and
$\elkey=\keyG$, $\elden=\keyG$, and $\elnum=\rnI$, for the
second annotation.

In most instances, a Roman numeral label will be of the form
$\elnum$, with $\elkey$ symbols appearing either at the
beginning of the piece or when a modulation occurs, and
$\elden$ symbols appearing when there is a tonicized key
$\elden \neq \elkey$.
