This section describes the \gls{natem} algorithm, which is
useful to retrieve a Roman numeral numerator $\elnum$ and
tonicization $\elden$ from a \gls{pcset} $\elpcset$ and key
$\elkey$, as shown in \refeq{natem}. This is useful when a
machine learning system only generates chord labels and
keys, which is often the case. 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:natem}
    \gls{natem}(\elpcset, \elkey) = \elnum\text{/}\elden
\end{equation}

The retrieval process can be summarized in two steps. The
first one is to acquire, if possible, the numerator $\elnum$
from the given $\elpcset$ and $\elkey$. If this is not
possible directly, the second, optional step, is to force a
tonicization to retrieve a tonicization $\elden$ such that
$\elden_\elkey \in \setkey_\elpcset$.
