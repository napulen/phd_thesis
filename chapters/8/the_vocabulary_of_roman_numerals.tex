There are 31 valid Roman numeral labels. These are indicated
in \reftab{rn_vocabulary}.

\phdtable[Vocabulary of valid Roman numeral labels for this
\gls{rna} method]{rn_vocabulary}

The Roman numeral vocabulary consists mainly of diatonic
harmonies that can be constructed from a major or minor
(i.e., harmonic minor) scale. A few chords are exceptions to
this rule, which I indicated as ``special chords.''
