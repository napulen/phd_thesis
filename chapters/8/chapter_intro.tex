This annex chapter presents a few technical ideas about
\gls{rna} that are relevant in various parts of the
dissertation (e.g., Chapters \ref{chap:modeldesign} and
\ref{chap:experimentalevaluation}). Thus, it is presented as
a self-contained chapter referenced throughout other
chapters.

\refsec{thestructureofaromannumeralanalysislabel} describes
the basic structure of a \gls{rna} label and its underlying
components. The subsequent sections describe the
vocabularies of Roman numeral numerators, denominators,
keys, inversions, and other musical symbols that are
relevant for systematic \gls{rna}.
% \refsec{thevocabularyofromannumerals} commences the
% discussion of the method by first defining the vocabulary
% of valid Roman numeral labels.\footnote{This vocabulary
% refers to the Roman numeral ``numerators'' of an
% annotation. For example, the $V$ in $\rn{V}/\rn{ii}$.}
% \refsec{thevocabularyofmusicalkeys} introduces the musical
% keys can be theoretically recognized by \gls{arna} system.
% This vocabulary of keys also has the purpose of
% constraining the vocabulary of chords (\gls{pcset}s).
% \refsec{thevocabularyofpitch-classsets} introduces the
% vocabulary of \gls{pcset}s that exist within the system.
% \refsec{analgorithmtoresolveromannumeralsfromapitch-classsetandkey}
% introduces an algorithm to resolve a Roman numeral label
% from the vocabulary, given a valid \gls{pcset} and key
% from the vocabulary.
% \refsec{analgorithmtoresolvetonicizations} introduces an
% algorithm to handle the situations where the Roman numeral
% does not exist for a given \gls{pcset} and key. In that
% case, a tonicization is forced, which will result in a
% valid Roman numeral label tonicizing a scale degree of the
% given key.
