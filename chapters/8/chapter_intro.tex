This annex chapter presents a few technical ideas about
\gls{rna} that are relevant in various parts of the
dissertation (e.g., Chapters 4--6). Thus, it made sense to
make it a self-contained chapter that could be referenced
throughout other chapters.

\refsec{thestructureofaromannumeralanalysislabel} describes
the structure of a \gls{rna} label. The subsequent sections
describe the vocabularies of Roman numeral numerators,
denominators, keys, inversion, and other musical symbols.
% \refsec{thevocabularyofromannumerals} commences the
% discussion of the method by first defining the vocabulary of
% valid Roman numeral labels.\footnote{This vocabulary refers
% to the Roman numeral ``numerators'' of an annotation. For
% example, the $V$ in $\rn{V}/\rn{ii}$.}
% \refsec{thevocabularyofmusicalkeys} introduces the musical
% keys can be theoretically recognized by \gls{arna} system.
% This vocabulary of keys also has the purpose of constraining
% the vocabulary of chords (\gls{pcset}s).
% \refsec{thevocabularyofpitch-classsets} introduces the
% vocabulary of \gls{pcset}s that exist within the system.
% \refsec{analgorithmtoresolveromannumeralsfromapitch-classsetandkey}
% introduces an algorithm to resolve a Roman numeral label
% from the vocabulary, given a valid \gls{pcset} and key from
% the vocabulary. \refsec{analgorithmtoresolvetonicizations}
% introduces an algorithm to handle the situations where the
% Roman numeral does not exist for a given \gls{pcset} and
% key. In that case, a tonicization is forced, which will
% result in a valid Roman numeral label tonicizing a scale
% degree of the given key.
