Given a pitch class set $\rho$ that is part of the finite
vocabulary of 121 pitch class sets and a key $\kappa$ that
is part of the finite vocabulary of 38 keys, the function
$\Gamma(\rho, \kappa) = \eta$ where $\eta$ is a Roman
numeral numerator from the bounded vocabulary of 31 Roman
numerals or the special symbol $chi$ if there is no Roman
numeral associated with that ($\rho$, $\kappa$) pair.
