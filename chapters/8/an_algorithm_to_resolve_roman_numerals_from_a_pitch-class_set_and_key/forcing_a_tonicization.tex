Consider the case of $\Gamma(\elpcset, \elkey)$ when
$\elpcset = \{0, 2, 6, 9\}$ and $\elkey = C$. The
\gls{pcset} corresponds to the pitches that would conform to
a $F\musSharp:\rnGer$, $G:\rnVsev$, $G\musFlat:\rnGer$,
$f\musSharp:\rnGer$, $g\musFlat:\rnGer$, or $g:\rnVsev$
chords, but it does not have a relationship with the key of
$C$. An experienced analyst would perhaps assume that the
chord is referring to a \emph{dominant of the dominant}
chord, $C:\rnVsev/V$. Thus, related to the interpretation
$G:\rnVsev$ but in a tonicized $G$ major key. Most of the
times that interpretation would be correct, however, it is
not trivial to disambiguate the tonicization context
programmatically.

One way to find a reasonable tonicization given the key
context is to use a key distance algorithm to find the
tonicization that would minimize the distance between the
key provided and the tonicization.
