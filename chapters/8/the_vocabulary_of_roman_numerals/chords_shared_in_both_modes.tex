Most of the chords in either mode are exclusive of that
mode. That is, the same scale degree in the opposite mode
has a different chord quality. Three diatonic chords are
shared between both modes, however: $\rnV$, $\rnVsev$, and
$viio$.

In addition to these chords, there are several ``special''
chords that are shared between the two modes.
