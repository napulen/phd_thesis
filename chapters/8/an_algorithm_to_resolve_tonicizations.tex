Consider the case of $\Gamma(\rho, \kappa)$ when $\rho =
\{0, 2, 6, 9\}$ and $\kappa = C$. The \gls{pcset}
corresponds to the pitches that would conform to a
$F\musSharp:\rnGer$, $G:\rnVsev$, $G\musFlat:\rnGer$,
$f\musSharp:\rnGer$, $g\musFlat:\rnGer$, or $g:\rnVsev$
chords, but it does not have a relationship with the $C$.
