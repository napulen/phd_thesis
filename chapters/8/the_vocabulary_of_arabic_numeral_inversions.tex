A Roman numeral numerator $\elnum$ can be in one of four
inversions: no inversion (or ``root position''), first
inversion, second inversion, and third inversion.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:inversion_vocabulary}
    \setinv = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \}
\end{equation}


However, the notation of the inversion in a \gls{rna} label
depends on several aspects. however, there are only
fourdetermined by a stack of arabic numerals

\begin{equation}
