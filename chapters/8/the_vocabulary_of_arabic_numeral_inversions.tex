A Roman numeral numerator $\elnum \in \setnum$ is said to be
in ``root position'' if the root of its chord is also acting
as the bass. If one of the other chord tones is taking the
role of the bass, the Roman numeral numerator is said to be
in either a first, second, or third inversion. Thus, the
vocabulary of inversions $\elinv$ for a numerator $\elnum$
is 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:inversion_vocabulary}
    \setinv = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \}
\end{equation}


However, the notation of the inversion in a \gls{rna} label
depends on several aspects. however, there are only
fourdetermined by a stack of arabic numerals
