A Roman numeral numerator $\elnum \in \setnum$ is said to be
in ``root position'' if the root of its chord is acting as
the bass of the chord. If one of the other chord tones acts
at as the bass, the Roman numeral numerator is said to be in
either a first, second, or third inversion. Thus, the
vocabulary of inversions $\elinv$ for a numerator $\elnum$ is 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:inversion_vocabulary}
    \setinv = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \}
\end{equation}


However, the notation of the inversion in a \gls{rna} label
depends on several aspects. however, there are only
fourdetermined by a stack of arabic numerals
