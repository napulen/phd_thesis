In a \gls{12tet} system, the same collection of pitch
classes may have different chord labels and/or \gls{rna}
labels. For example, the set of pitch classes $\{0$, $4$,
$7\}$ may be called a ``C major'' chord, or a ``B$\musSharp$
major'' chord; in \gls{rna}, it is called $\rnV$ if it
appears in the context of the $F$ major key, or $\rnN$ if it
appears in the context of the $b$ minor key. However, in all
of those instances, the collection of pitch classes is the
same. The attribute that disambiguates the different names
of that pitch class set is the key context.
