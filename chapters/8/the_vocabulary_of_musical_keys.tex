If all enharmonic keys are collapsed into the same key
class, then there is a set of 24 major-and-minor keys.
However, when two enharmonic keys are considered different
keys, there are an infinite number of keys. For the first
case, the keys can be arranged in a circular structure, such
as the circle of fifths, because eventually the classes will
repeat. For the second case, the keys can be arranged in a
line \parencite{temperley2000line}.

For a computational system, distinguishing between
enharmonics is easier if the vocabulary of keys is bounded.
Furthermore, many of those keys exist in theory, but would
rarely (or never) occur in practice. For example, the key of
$C\musDoubleSharp$ major.

In the proposed system, the vocabulary of keys was bounded.
The number of available keys was determined in a data-driven
way. By inspecting the examples provided in the aggregated
dataset of \gls{rna} annotations (see
\refsec{aggregatingallavailabledatasets}), it was determined
that most annotations lie within the range of keys between
$B\musDoubleFlat$ and $D\musSharp$ for the major keys, and
$g\musFlat$ and $b\musSharp$ for the minor keys. Thus, the
vocabulary of keys considered in this \thesisdiss{} spans
all the keys in that range. This results in 38 keys.
