If all enharmonic keys are collapsed into the same key
class, then there is a set of 24 major-and-minor keys.
However, when two enharmonic keys are considered different
keys, there are an infinite number of keys. For the first
case, the keys can be arranged in a circular structure, such
as the circle of fifths, because eventually the classes will
repeat. For the second case, the keys can be arranged in a
line \parencite{temperley2000line}.

For a computational system, distinguishing between
enharmonics is easier if the vocabulary of keys is bounded.
Furthermore, many of those keys exist in theory, but would
rarely (or never) occur in practice. For example, the key of
$C\musDoubleSharp$ major.
