Most of the chords in either mode are exclusive of that
mode. That is, the same scale degree in the opposite mode
has a different chord quality. Three diatonic chords are
shared between both modes, however: $\rnV$, $\rnVsev$, and
$\rnviio$. 

The $\rnCad$ is a special case among the diatonic triads.
Unlike all other Roman numerals, which have one and only one
associated chord quality, a $\rnCad$ may be a major or minor
triad, depending on the key's mode. In addition to the
$\rnCad$ chord, there are other special chords shared
between the two modes.
