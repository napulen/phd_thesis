A chord often found in the dataset is an augmented dominant
chord. This chord is also common in the minor mode, however,
it is an enharmonic of the $\rnIIIaug$ triad of that mode.
Thus, the \gls{pcset} resolution collides for these two
chords. The way this was addressed in the system was to
consider $\rnVaug$ as a chord exclusive of the major mode and
$\rnIIIaug$ as a chord exclusive of the minor mode. When the
system is trying to resolve a \gls{pcset} that conforms to
an augmented triad, it will be resolved as either $\rnIIIaug$
or $\rnVaug$ depending on the resolution of the key.
