A chord often found in the dataset is an augmented dominant
chord. This chord is also common in the minor mode, however,
it is an enharmonic of the $\rnIIIaug$ triad of that mode.
In order for the algorithm described in
\refsec{analgorithmtoresolveromannumeralsfromapitch-classsetandkey}
to work, it is required that a given \gls{pcset} $\elpcset$
has only one Roman numeral numerator $\elnum$ for a given
key, a condition that would not be met for $\rnIIIaug$ and
$\rnVaug$ coexisting in a minor key. The way this was
addressed was to consider $\rnVaug$ as a chord exclusive of
the major mode and $\rnIIIaug$ as a chord exclusive of the
minor mode. When the system is trying to resolve a
\gls{pcset} $\elpcset$ that conforms to an augmented triad,
it will be resolved as either $\rnIIIaug$ or $\rnVaug$
depending on the mode of the key.
