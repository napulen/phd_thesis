% This is \refsec{digitizationofromannumeralannotations},
% which introduces the digitization of roman numeral
% annotations.

Because the Roman numeral notation evolved in a rather
unstructured way, there is no \emph{standard} way of writing
Roman numeral annotations. 
% Personally, studying with several harmony teachers from
% Guadalajara, Barcelona, and Montreal, I noticed that each
% of these teachers used a slightly different notation. A
% survey of the Harmony literature (see
% \reftab{primsources}) will reveal something similar among
% published works. 
Some of the common variations include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of case-sensitive or case-insensitive numerals
    \item Different ways of denoting certain chords,
    notably, the so-called ``cadential six-four''
    chord\footnote{Particularly, there is currently a heated
    debate about annotating these chords as
    $\rn{I}\rnsixfour$ or $\rn{V}\rnsixfour$}
    \item Different notations for other chords (e.g.,
    \gls{neapolitan} written as either $\flat\rn{II}\rnsix$
    or $\rn{N}\rnsix$)
    \item Different ways of notating inversions (using the
    letters a--d or stacks of Arabic numerals)
\end{itemize}

\guide{Case-sensitive versus case-insensitive Roman numerals.}
A clear separation of chord qualities (major and minor)
using case-sensitive Roman numerals has been proposed since
\textcite{weber1818versuch}. However, some analysts have
preferred to indicate the scale degrees using an upper-case
Roman numeral, regardless of the chord quality implied by
the chord. This is often fine for human analysts, as the
reader of the analysis will usually be able to complement
the information. Computers will not be easily able to
disambiguate this notation, however. In digital annotations,
having explicit information about the chord quality is
unequivocally better. Every digital representation considers
Roman numerals to be case-sensitive for that reason.

\guide{Cadential six-four chords.}
A tonic triad in second inversion is a chord frequently used
before a cadence. When it is used in this context (preceding
a $\rn{V}$ chord) it receives the name of
\gls{cadentialsixfour}.\footnote{There is more to
\gls{cadentialsixfour} chords, which often puts them in
the middle of heated music-theoretical debates. Two recent
surveys on the topic include \textcite{mirka2015mystery} and
\textcite{ninov2016functional}.} In order to indicate this
chord using Roman numerals, it is common to write it as
$\rn{I}\rnsixfour$, $\rn{V}\rnsixfour$, or
$\rn{Cad}\rnsixfour$. Out of these, the least ambiguous
representation for a digital annotation is
$\rn{Cad}\rnsixfour$, as it disambiguates the chord as
functioning in this specific way and not as a passing chord
(e.g., a second-inversion tonic or dominant triads could be
passing chords, which are neither considered a cadential
six-four). \reffig{v64_i64_and_cad64} exemplifies the
suggested use of $\rn{I}\rnsixfour$, $\rn{V}\rnsixfour$, and
$\rn{Cad}\rnsixfour$ chords in machine-readable annotations,
with all ambiguity removed.

 representations][1.0]{v64_i64_and_cad64}

\guide{Neapolitans, Augmented sixth chords, and other conventions.}
\gls{neapolitan} chords are often considered a chromatic
substitution of the subdominant chord. The root of the chord
is the flattened second degree of the relevant major/minor
key. For example, the \gls{neapolitan} of $\rn{C major}$
(and $\rn{C minor}$) is $\rn{D}\flat$. For this reason, it
is either known as $\flat\rn{II}$ or as $\rn{N}$.

\guide{Notating inversions.}
Inversions are generally notated using stacked Arabic
numerals. The conventions for common triad and seventh
chords are relatively standardized. These are indicated in
\reftab{inversions}.

numerals or letters. Figures between square brackets are
optional]{inversions}

Inversions have also been indicated with letters. This
notation is common since the 19\textsuperscript{th} century.
It is also the notation of the first digital standard for
\gls{rna}, \gls{humharm}.

% The need for a standard
In the music theory classroom setting, the flexibility of
the notation is perhaps a desirable goal. Students may be
encouraged to develop their own ``style'' of tonal analysis,
incorporating aspects of voice-leading, motivic, and key
analysis, as they see fit. This is useful to extend the
intrinsic limitations of \gls{rna} to summarize tonal music.

Excessive flexibility may be an issue, however, in
computational work. Idiosyncratic and undocumented methods
of analysis lead to incompatible annotations. It is
unfeasible to assume that a single person will be able to
annotate a sufficiently large number of Roman numeral
analyses to be used for computational models. Thus, the
compatibility between different annotations is a necessity,
as well as the cooperation between expert analysts. This can
only be achieved by standardizing the \gls{rna} notation.
Several notational systems have emerged over the years to
attempt to solve this problem.

In the rest of this section, I will review four efforts
toward the standardization and digitization of \gls{rna}
labels.
