% This is \refsubsubsec{thedcmlstandard},
% which introduces the the dcml standard.

The DCML standard for harmonic annotations refers to a
standard developed at the Digital and Cognitive Musicology
Lab at \'Ecole Polytechnique F\'ed\'erale de Lausanne.

This standard was first used in the annotation of the
Beethoven Annotated Corpus (ABC)
\parencite{neuwirth2018annotated}. Since then, it has been
revised and documented in a dedicated
repository\footnote{\href{https://github.com/DCMLab/standards}{https://github.com/DCMLab/standards}}
and reference
manual\footnote{\href{https://dcmlab.github.io/standards/build/html/reference/reference.html}{https://dcmlab.github.io/standards/build/html/reference/reference.html}}.

The revised has been used in a subsequent iteration of the
ABC dataset (version 2) as well as a separate dataset of
Mozart Piano Sonatas \parencite{hentschel2021annotated}.
