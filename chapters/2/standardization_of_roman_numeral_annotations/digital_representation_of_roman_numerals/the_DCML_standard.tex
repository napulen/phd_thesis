% This is \refsubsubsec{thedcmlstandard}, which introduces
% the the dcml standard.

This standard for harmonic annotations was developed at the
\gls{dcml} at the \'Ecole Polytechnique F\'ed\'erale de
Lausanne.

This standard was first used in the annotation of the
\gls{abc}
\parencite{neuwirth2018annotated}. Since then, it has been
revised and documented in a dedicated
repository\footnotelink{https://github.com/DCMLab/standards}
and a reference
manual.\footnotelink{https://dcmlab.github.io/standards/build/html/reference/reference.html}

In addition to the repository and reference manual, the
community behind this standard has also made available an
annotation
tutorial,\footnotelink{https://dcmlab.github.io/standards/build/html/tutorial/index.html},
an annotation workflow that discusses version control
practices,\footnotelink{https://dcmlab.github.io/standards/build/html/git/git.html},
a set of instructions for corpus creation (described by
\gls{dcml} as the corpus-creation
pipelin),\footnotelink{https://dcmlab.github.io/standards/build/html/pipeline/pipeline.html},
and a page of questions and
examples,\footnotelink{https://dcmlab.github.io/standards/build/html/reference/examples.html},
among other resources. From the perspective of documentation
and standardization, this is perhaps the most thoroughly
described standard for \gls{rna} in existence today.

The revised version of the standard has been used in a
subsequent iteration of the \gls{abc} dataset (version 2) as
well as the \gls{mps} dataset
\parencite{hentschel2021annotated}. Other collections exist
in a private archive and are expected to be publicly
available one day.
