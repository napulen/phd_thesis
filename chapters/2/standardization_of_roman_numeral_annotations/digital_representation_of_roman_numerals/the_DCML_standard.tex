% This is \refsubsubsec{thedcmlstandard}, which introduces
% the the dcml standard.

The DCML standard for harmonic annotations refers to a
standard developed at the \gls{dcml} at the \'Ecole
Polytechnique F\'ed\'erale de Lausanne.

This standard was first used in the annotation of the
\gls{abc}
\parencite{neuwirth2018annotated}. Since then, it has been
revised and documented in a dedicated
repository\footnotelink{https://github.com/DCMLab/standards}
and reference
manual\footnotelink{https://dcmlab.github.io/standards/build/html/reference/reference.html}.

The revised has been used in a subsequent iteration of the
ABC dataset (version 2) as well as a separate dataset of
Mozart Piano Sonatas \parencite{hentschel2021annotated}.
