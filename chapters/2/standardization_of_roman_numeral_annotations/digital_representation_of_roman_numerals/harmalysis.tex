% This is \refsubsubsec{harmalysis}, which introduces the
% harmalysis.

\emph{Harmalysis} is an \gls{rna} grammar introduced in
\textcite{napoleslopez2020harmalysis}.

The \emph{harmalysis} grammar is based mainly on Huron's
\gls{humharm} syntax (see \refsubsubsec{humdrum(**harm)}).
The syntax is extended by borrowing elements from the
\gls{romantext} format, such as Arabic numeral inversions
(see \refsubsubsec{RomanText}), music notation fonts for
\gls{rna},\footnotelink{https://github.com/MarcSabatella/Campania}
and conventions observed in existing datasets of \gls{rna}.
As  a result,  the \emph{harmalysis} syntax is a superset of
the \gls{humharm} syntax,  which includes additional
features and supports a wider range of customs of harmonic
analysis.

The main advantage of this syntax is that it is formally
defined as a context-free grammar. Thus, the exact
mathematical validation of the syntax is available for
review and discussion, which might not be the case for
representations defined by their textual explanations.
