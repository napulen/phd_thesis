% This is \refsubsubsec{harmalysis}, which introduces the
% harmalysis.

\emph{Harmalysis} is a \gls{rna} grammar introduced in
\textcite{napoleslopez2020harmalysis}.

The \emph{harmalysis} grammar is based mainly on Huron‘s
\gls{humharm} syntax (see \refsubsubsec{humdrum(**harm)}).
The syntax is extended by borrowing elements from the
\gls{romantext} format (see \refsubsubsec{RomanText}),
MuseScore's notation for
\gls{rna}\footnote{\href{https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols\#rna}{https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/chord-symbols}},
and conventions observed in existing datasets of \gls{rna}.
As  a result,  the harmalysis language is a superset  of the
\gls{humharm} syntax,  which includes additional features
and supports a wider range of customs of harmonic analysis.

The main advantage of this syntax is that it is formally
defined as a context-free grammar. Thus, the exact
mathematical validation of the syntax is available for
review and discussion, which might not be the case for
representations defined by their textual explanations.
