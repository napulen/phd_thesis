% This is \refsubsubsec{humdrum(**harm)},
% which introduces the humdrum(**harm).

The \gls{humharm} syntax was proposed by David Huron as part
of the Humdrum (\gls{humkern}) format. This syntax includes
a comprehensive notation of triads, seventh chords, special
chords, and descriptive (arbitrary) chords using Roman
numeral notation. The notation is well documented, although
several aspects of the notation are missing from the
explanations.

The original \gls{humharm} documentation is available
online.\footnote{\href{https://www.humdrum.org/Humdrum/representations/harm.rep.html}{https://www.humdrum.org/Humdrum/representations/harm.rep.html}}
The notation summarizes the description of chords based on
four attributes: (1) chord root, (2) chord type, (3)
inversion, and (4) chord alterations. Chord roots are
indicated with Roman numerals. Chord types (or qualities)
are indicated with a case-sensitive notation of the Roman
numeral plus the symbols `$\rn{+}$' and `$\rn{o}$'
indicating augmented and diminished triads, respectively.
All chord inversions are indicated with the letters $\{a, b,
c, d\}$, which indicate root position, first inversion,
second inversion, and third inversion, respectively. The
alterations, indicated with `$\rn{-}$' and
`\textbf{\#}', shift the pitch of the Roman numeral
scale degree, most often when indicating non-diatonic
chords.
