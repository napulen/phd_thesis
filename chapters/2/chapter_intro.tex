\gls{rna} is a common methodology in contemporary music
theory textbooks dealing with tonal music. The name derives
from the use of Roman numerals to denote scale degrees,
which, in turn, indicate diatonic chords in a certain
musical key. The musical key is usually prepended to the
first Roman numeral of the piece, using a case-sensitive
note letter\footnote{Generally, upper-case letters are used
to indicate major keys, and lower-case letters are used to
indicate minor keys.} followed by a colon. When there are
changes of key throughout the piece, these are indicated in
a similar way, with a new key and colon symbol prepended to
a Roman numeral.

\gls{rna} is an alternative system to the, possibly more
popular, chord label system. It may be that Roman numeral
analysis is more common among tonal music theory textbooks,
because these textbooks often present musical examples of
the common-practice period, as opposed to modern popular
music. In this type of music (i.e., common-practice tonal
music), the changes of key and other indications of the
Roman numerals are very helpful to break down a piece
analytically. \reffig{rnandcl} shows a fragment of music
annotated with both Roman numeral and chord label
annotations.
