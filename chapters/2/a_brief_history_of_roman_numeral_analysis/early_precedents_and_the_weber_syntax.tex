Before the development of the \gls{rna} syntax, Roman
numerals were used to indicate scale-degree relationships.
For example, in two tables of \emph{Die Kunst der reinen
Satzes in der Musik} by \textcite{kirnberger1774kunst},
shown in \reffig{primary_sources/kirnberger1774kunst015}.

Later, \textcite{vogler1778grunde, vogler1802handbuch}
introduced the first Roman numeral symbols underneath a
staff, which also referred to a scale degree. These are used
a few times on both works.
\reffig{primary_sources/vogler1778grunde021} shows an
example in \textcite{vogler1778grunde}.

While it is difficult to credit someone with ``inventing''
Roman numeral analysis, the modern notation would probably
not exist without the precedent of
\textcite{weber1817versuch}. Weber extended the notation to
indicate not only scale degrees but their chord quality. A
special notation separates diminished triads (i.e., the
seventh degree) from major and minor chords; whereas major
and minor are distinguished by the size of the Roman
numeral.\footnote{Nowadays, it is more common to see
upper- and lower-case Roman numerals to indicate major and
minor triads, respectively.} Weber introduced several other
traits of modern \gls{rna}. For example, changes of key are
indicated using a colon ``$\rn{:}$'' symbol and analyses
with several rows of keys and Roman numeral indications
appear in modulating passages. Finally, whereas previous
theorists used the Roman numeral notations sporadically,
Weber exercised this notation thoroughly in the
\emph{Versuch einer geordneten Theorie der Tonsetzkunst}
\parencite{weber1817versuch}. Here, Weber also indicated
dominant seventh chords as $\rn{V}\rnseven$, a notation that
is still in use today. Whereas others relied on figured bass
to explain their examples, Weber relied mostly on Roman
numerals.

\phdfigure[Roman numerals in \textcite{weber1817versuch}. Keys are indicated with colons (e.g., mm. 1 and mm.5). Dominant seventh chords are indicated as $\rn{V}\rnseven$. Smaller Roman numerals indicate minor triads][1.0]{primary_sources/weber1817versuch205}
