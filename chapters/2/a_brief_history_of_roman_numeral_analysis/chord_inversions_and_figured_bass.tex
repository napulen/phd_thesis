During the earlier \gls{rna} examples of the nineteenth
century, it was common to complement the notation with
figured bass. The figured bass was often clearly separated
from the Roman numerals, for example, by annotating one
below the staff and the other one above, as seen in
\reffig{primary_sources/hamilton1840cathecism044} or
\reffig{primary_sources/meister1852vollstandige32}.

An interesting example by \textcite{bussler1878praktische},
however, shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/bussler1878praktische063}, shows the
Roman numerals and figured bass annotations in the same
analytical layer. One could claim that this syntax is an
early version of the modern chord inversion syntax, where
inversions are denoted by stacks of Arabic numerals next to
the Roman numeral.

This practice is further developed by
\textcite{emery1879elements}.
