An interesting example by \textcite{bussler1878praktische}
is shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/bussler1878praktische063}, who
presents Roman numerals and figured bass annotations in the
same analytical layer. One could claim that this syntax is
an early version of the modern chord inversion syntax, where
inversions are denoted by stacks of Arabic numerals next to
the Roman numeral.

\phdfigure[A single layer of chord annotations underneath the bass staff in \textcite{bussler1878praktische}, where Roman numerals and figured bass labels are intertwined][1.0]{primary_sources/bussler1878praktische063}

This practice is further developed by
\textcite{emery1879elements}.
