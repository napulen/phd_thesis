During the \gls{rna} examples of the 19\textsuperscript{th}
century that followed \textcite{weber1818versuch}, it was
common to complement the notation with figured bass. The
figured bass was often clearly separated from the Roman
numerals, for example, by annotating one below the staff and
the other one above, as seen in Figures
\ref{fig:primary_sources/hamilton1840cathecism044},
\ref{fig:primary_sources/meister1852vollstandige32}, or
\ref{fig:primary_sources/emery1879elements051}.

In \reffig{primary_sources/bussler1878praktische063},
however, a differing example in
\textcite{bussler1878praktische} shows the Roman numerals
and figured bass annotations in the same analytical layer.
One could argue that this syntax is an early version of the
modern chord inversion syntax, where inversions are denoted
by Arabic numerals next to the Roman numeral. In principle,
those Arabic numerals represent intervals, as in the figured
bass notation. However, in \gls{rna}, it is common to see
certain ``stacks'' of Arabic numerals appearing often, such
as $\rnseven$, $\rnsixfive$, $\rnsixfour$, $\rnfourthree$,
or $\rntwo$. Nowadays, these stacks are generally understood
as ``chord inversions.'' 

The practice of using Arabic numerals in \gls{rna} was
further developed in \textcite{emery1879elements}, shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/emery1879elements051}. In Emery's
example, it is clearer that the stacks of Arabic numerals in
the \gls{rna} layer have a special meaning, as figured bass
annotations also appear above the staff. These stacks of
Arabic numerals are indicators of special chords, which will
be discussed in
\refsubsec{neapolitans,augmentedsixths,andotherspecialchords}.

\phdfigure[Use of Roman numerals and figured bass in
\textcite[51]{emery1879elements}. In the Roman numeral
layer, stacks of Arabic numerals indicate \gls{augsix}
chords. Additionally, a notation for \gls{neapolitan} chords
is introduced. See
\refsubsec{neapolitans,augmentedsixths,andotherspecialchords}
for further discussion of \gls{neapolitan} and \gls{augsix}
chords][0.85]{primary_sources/emery1879elements051}

In addition to the special chords in
\textcite{emery1879elements}, the so-called
\gls{cadentialsixfour} chord could have also encouraged the
numeric notation for chord inversions.

\textcite{shepard1896harmony} included figured bass
annotations next to the Roman numeral to indicate certain
chord inversions, notably, the \gls{cadentialsixfour} chord,
as shown in \reffig{primary_sources/shepard1896harmony184}.
This notation was consistent even when there was no music
notation involved. In such case, Shepard would write the
Arabic numerals next to the Roman numeral in plain-text
form, as shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/shepard1896harmony117}.

\phdfigure[Numeric inversions in plain-text, without

\parencite[117]{shepard1896harmony}][0.6]{primary_sources/shepard1896harmony117}

\textcite{chadwick1897harmony} followed a similar practice,
also indicating the numeric inversions in examples without
music notation, as shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/chadwick1897harmony038}.
\textcite{chadwick1897harmony} also provided an explanation
of the numeric inversions, shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/chadwick1897harmony012}. This
notation goes beyond triads, including, for example
$\rn{V}\rnfourthree$, as shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/chadwick1897harmony028}.

Finally, a more compelling example of the role of
\gls{cadentialsixfour} chords in the notation of chord
inversions can be seen in \textcite{loewengard1908lehrbuch},
where the \gls{cadentialsixfour} figure
($\rn{I}\rnsixfour$) has the numeric inversion notation, but
the $\rn{ii}\rnsix$ chord in the same line does not (see
\reffig{primary_sources/loewengard1908lehrbuch045}).

An alternative notation for chord inversions adopted by
several theorists consists of the use of letters. In
\textcite{cutter1902harmonic}, both notations are explained:

\begin{italicsquote}
    The inversions of triads and of seventh chords, both
    principal and secondary, will be indicated by the
    customary figurings: $\rnsix$, $\rnsixfour$,
    $\rnsixfive$, $\rnfourthree$, $\rnfourtwo$, attached to
    the respective Roman numerals. Or, the letters
    \textbf{a}, \textbf{b}, \textbf{c}, \textbf{d}, meaning
    root-form, first, second, and third inversions, may be
    used with these same numerals. Thus:
    $\rn{I}_\rnformat{a}$, $\rn{I}_\rnformat{b}$,
    $\rn{I}_\rnformat{c}$,
    $\rn{ii}\rndim{}^\rnformat{7}_\rnformat{a}$,
    $\rn{ii}\rndim{}^\rnformat{7}_\rnformat{b}$,
    $\rn{ii}\rndim{}^\rnformat{7}_\rnformat{c}$,
    $\rn{IV}^\rnformat{+}_\rnformat{a}$,
    $\rn{iii}^\rnformat{7}_\rnformat{c}$, etc. The
    diminished seventh chord, in its various forms, will be
    marked: $\rn{vii}^\rnformat{o}_\rnformat{7o}$,
    $\rn{vii}\rndim\rnsixfive$,
    $\rn{vii}\rndim\rnfourthree$, $\rn{vii}\rndim\rnfourtwo$
    --- or
    $\rn{vii}^{\rnformat{o}}_{\rnformat{a}}{}^\rnformat{7o}$,
    $\rn{vii}^{\rnformat{o}}_{\rnformat{b}}{}^\rnformat{7o}$,
    $\rn{vii}^{\rnformat{o}}_{\rnformat{c}}{}^\rnformat{7o}$,
    $\rn{vii}^{\rnformat{o}}_{\rnformat{d}}{}^\rnformat{7o}$.

The numeric inversion syntax was already used by previous
theorists, however, the letters ${a, b, c , d}$ appear for
the first time in \textcite{cutter1902harmonic} among the
books surveyed. Cutter also seems to be the only author
acknowledging the existence of both notations, possibly
because his treatise was on harmonic analysis, rather than a
harmony textbook. Throughout the examples, however, only the
numeric inversions are used.

The notation for chord inversions based on letters is less
common than the stacks of Arabic numerals. One place where
the letter notation was preferred was
\textcite{york1909practical}, where it appears prominently.
\reffig{primary_sources/york1909practical019} shows the
introduction of the chord inversion notation used by York.
