The stacks of Arabic numerals in Emery's example
(\reffig{primary_sources/emery1879elements051}) describe
\gls{augsix} chords. This is possibly the first time that
the \gls{rna} notation is extended to describe chords that
lie beyond the diatonic harmonies occurring in major and
minor scales.\footnote{Annotating special chords, such as a
\gls{neapolitan} or \gls{augsix} chords is probably one of
the most important characteristics of \gls{rna} to this day,
as these chords are generally beyond the scope of
traditional chord labels. Presumably, this is because
identifying these chords requires an understanding of the
key, an aspect that is generally neglected in traditional
chord labels but intrinsically available in \gls{rna}.}
\textcite{shepard1896harmony} adopted a similar notation for
\gls{augsix} chords, as shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/shepard1896harmony137}. Eventually,
these chords would received their own symbols ($\rn{It}$,
$\rn{Fr}$, and $\rn{Ger}$) instead of Arabic numerals,
although that syntax would only be established in the
twentieth century.
\reffig{primary_sources/goldman1965harmony086} shows a more
modern example in \textcite{goldman1965harmony}, which made
use of the new symbols.

Emery also introduced a special symbol to annotate
\gls{neapolitan} chords, $\rn{N.6}$. Similarly to
\textcite{emery1879elements}, Chadwick annotated
\gls{neapolitan} chords using a special figure, $\rn{N}$.
Chadwick was explicit in displaying a \gls{neapolitan} as
being in first inversion, which is its most common
arrangement. Thus, the syntax, shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/chadwick1897harmony148}, featured
the inversion figure ``6'' next to the letter ``N'', in the
form of $\rn{N}\rnsix$. \textcite{heacox1907lessons},
\textcite{alchin1921applied}, and other sources adopted this
syntax as well. \textcite{heacox1907lessons} notated
different chord inversions of the \gls{neapolitan} using the
corresponding stacks of Arabic numerals.

Another Roman numeral symbol that received attention in the
late 19\textsuperscript{th} century was the augmented triad.
In the early syntax introduced in
\textcite{weber1817versuch}, there were no examples of
augmented triads. Thus, the notation did not include a
symbol for them. \textcite{richter1860lehrbuch} was arguably
the first source introducing the single-quote symbol to
denote augmented triads (see
\reffig{primary_sources/richter1860lehrbuch34}). This
notation was adopted by several others, including
\textcite{jadassohn1883lehrbuch},
\textcite{broekhoven1889system}, \textcite{buwa1893schule},
and \textcite{shepard1896harmony}. However, it is a fairly
rare notation nowadays. Much more common is the use of
$\rn{III+}$, with a plus ($+$) symbol in place of the single
quote. This notation, shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/riemann1890katechismus064}, was
perhaps popularized after \textcite{riemann1890katechismus},
as Riemann seems to be the first one introducing it. A few
years later, \textcite{chadwick1897harmony} adopted it, and
others followed.
