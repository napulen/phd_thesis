Emery also introduced a special symbol to denote Neapolitan
chords, $\rn{N.6}$. For the augmented sixth chords (i.e.,
Italian, French, and German), Emery uses a stack of Arabic
numerals. The example shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/emery1879elements051} shows this
notation. Notice that additionally to the stack of Arabic
numerals in the layer of Roman numeral analysis, Emery also
presents a figured bass layer above the staff. Lastly,
Emery's notation for the augmented sixth quality is the
$\rn{+}$ symbol. Nowadays, used to denote augmented triads
as well (e.g., $\rn{c:III+}$ in the C harmonic minor scale).
Up to this point, the notation for modulations is to
indicate the changes of key at the level of the Roman
numeral annotations. A full example of the notation can be
seen in another excerpt by Emery, shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/emery1879elements102}.

A notation for augmented triads was introduced by
\textcite{jadassohn1883lehrbuch}, who used a single quote
after the augmented scale degree.

This syntax of the single-quote augmented triad appeared in
at least the treatises by \textcite{broekhoven1889system},
\textcite{buwa1893schule}, and
\textcite{shepard1896harmony}.
