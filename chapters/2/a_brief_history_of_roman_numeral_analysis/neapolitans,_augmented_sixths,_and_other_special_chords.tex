The stacks of Arabic numerals in Emery's example
(\reffig{primary_sources/emery1879elements051}) describe
augmented sixth chords (i.e., Italian, French, and German).
This is possibly the first time that the \gls{rna} notation
is extended to describe such kind of chords, beyond the
diatonic harmonies occurring in major and minor scales. This
is an important characteristic of the notation to this day,
as these chords are generally beyond the vocabulary of
traditional chord labels. Emery also introduced a special
symbol to annotate Neapolitan chords,\footnote{Another kind
of chord that is generally neglected in chord label
vocabularies.} $\rn{N.6}$. 

Lastly, Emery's notation for the augmented sixth quality is
the $\rn{+}$ symbol. Nowadays, used to denote augmented
triads as well (e.g., $\rn{c:III+}$ in the C harmonic minor
scale). Up to this point, the notation for modulations is to
indicate the changes of key at the level of the Roman
numeral annotations. A full example of the notation can be
seen in another excerpt by Emery, shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/emery1879elements102}.

\phdfigure[Modulations in \textcite{emery1879elements}. Notice that five keys are indicated within eight measures of music, an usually large number of key changes for modern practices. In the modern practice, some of these annotations (e.g., the two D-minor chords) would be expressed as \emph{tonicizations}][1.0]{primary_sources/emery1879elements102}

A notation for augmented triads was introduced by
\textcite{jadassohn1883lehrbuch}, who used a single quote
after the augmented scale degree.

This syntax of the single-quote augmented triad appeared in
at least the treatises by \textcite{broekhoven1889system},
\textcite{buwa1893schule}, and
\textcite{shepard1896harmony}.
