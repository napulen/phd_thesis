%% EMERY's MODULATION Lastly, Emery's notation for the
% augmented sixth quality is the $\rn{+}$ symbol. Nowadays,
% used to denote augmented triads as well (e.g.,
% $\rn{c:III+}$ in the C harmonic minor scale). Up to this
% point, the notation for modulations is to indicate the
% changes of key at the level of the Roman numeral
% annotations. A full example of the notation can be seen in
% another excerpt by Emery, shown in
% \reffig{primary_sources/emery1879elements102}.

% Notice that five keys are indicated within eight measures
% of music, an usually large number of key changes for
% modern practices. In the modern practice, some of these
% annotations (e.g., the two D-minor chords) would be

An important component of the modern Roman numeral analysis
syntax is the one used for tonicizations. Tonicizations are
slight deviations of key, which usually return to the
original key, without ``invoking'' a modulation. Nowadays,
tonicizations are generally written with a slash symbol,
where the numerator indicates the scale degree and the
denominator indicates the tonicized key. A common example is
$\rn{V/V}$ or (dominant of the dominant). It is unclear
where this notation originally emerged, however, a similar
notation was introduced by \textcite{shepard1889how}.
Shepard's notation, which he calls ``[A]ttendant chords'',
is presented as ``$\rn{[A] of V}$'' in the notation, shown
in \reffig{primary_sources/shepard1889how005}. This is
analogous to the modern $\rn{V/V}$. An advantage of the
modern notation is that other degrees other than $\rn{V}$
(in the numerator) can be annotated using the same
syntax.\footnote{\textcite{piston1941harmony}, in fact, used
Shepard's notation in this way, using a syntax of the form
``$\rn{V of V}$''.} In the explanations of his modulation
method, Shepard also introduces a modulation ``formula''
that resembles the fraction-like notation we use today (see
\reffig{primary_sources/shepard1889how010}).

\textcite{halm1900harmonielehre} can be considered another
pioneer of the $\rn{V/V}$ notation. He used a similar
notation, $\rn{V--V}$, to refer to secondary dominant
chords. However, the meaning of this notation is not very
concise. For instance, it is used in the form of $\rn{I--V}$
and $\rn{I--IV}$ to denote chords that act as tonics in one
key and as dominants in another. Yet, that notation would
lead to a mistaken interpretation in the case of
$\rn{V--V}$.\footnote{Which should perhaps be written as
$\sharp{}\rn{II--V}$} Nevertheless, the notation is similar
to the modern way of thinking about applied chords. An
example of Halm's notation is shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/halm1900harmonielehreXVII}

Schenker adopted several notational conventions in
\emph{Neue Musikalische Theorien und Phantasien:
Harmonielehre} \parencite{schenker1906neue}. Throughout this
book, pivot chords that have multiple meanings in different
keys are usually expressed in Roman numerals. Schenker
sometimes uses the notation $\rn{VI=IV}$, and other times
$\rn{VI/IV}$. One of his specific examples can be seen in
\reffig{primary_sources/schenker1906neue190},
% \ref{fig:primary_sources/schenker1906neue079} and
% \ref{fig:primary_sources/schenker1906neue190}.

An interesting notation for secondary dominants appears in
\textcite{white1911harmonic}, where it seems to be
introduced particularly for diminished seventh chords. In
this notation, secondary dominants are presented within
parentheses, indicating the key they tonicize. It is clear
that these changes of key are short-lived, not affecting the
key of the next chord after the closing parenthesis. This is
consistent with a notation of \emph{tonicizations} and
\emph{modulations}, as seen in recent works of computational
music theory. An example of this notation is shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/white1911harmonic110}.

% The Roman numeral notation by Gilson is a mixture of
% Riemannian functions and scale-degree Roman numerals, an
% unconventional style in current workflows. Gilson also
% introduced the notation $\rn{VV}$ for \emph{dominant of
% the dominant} chords (see
% \reffig{primary_sources/gilson1919traite090}).


% The modern notation for tonicizations appears in
