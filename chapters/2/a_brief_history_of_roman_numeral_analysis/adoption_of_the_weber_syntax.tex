% This is \refsubsec{adoptionofthewebersyntax}, which
% introduces the adoption of the weber syntax.

The notational system introduced by
\textcite{weber1817versuch} was not immediately adopted by
other theorists. 

% Sometimes, the notation would be partially adopted, for
% example, utilizing Roman numerals but not distinguishing 

One of the first adopters of Roman numerals 
% I could find among my list of primary sources 
was \textcite{hamilton1840catechism}. Hamilton, and several
others, did not adopt the case-sensitive notation for chord
qualities. All scale degrees are indicated with a single
Roman numeral style, regardless of their chord qualities. In
Hamilton's annotations, Roman numerals indicate melodic
scale degrees, instead of chord roots, as shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/hamilton1840cathecism044}.

\phdfigure[Use of Roman numerals in \textcite{hamilton1840catechism}, indicating the scale degree of the bass, regardless of the chord root. In modern Roman numeral notation, these annotations would be written as $\rn{V}\rnsixfive$, $\rn{V}\rnfourthree$, $\rn{V}\rntwo$, $\rn{V}\rnfourthree$, and $\rn{V}\rnseven$, respectively]{primary_sources/hamilton1840cathecism044}

The next adopter of the Roman numeral notation among German
theorists appears to be \textcite{meister1852vollstandige}.
Meister often accompanies the Roman numeral notation with
chord labels and figured bass indications, as in
\reffig{primary_sources/meister1852vollstandige32}.

Other authors adopted Roman numerals in the nineteenth
century \parencite{sechter1853grundsatze,
richter1860lehrbuch, tiersch1874elementarbuch,
tracy1878theory}.
