\textcite{hamilton1840catechism}, indicating the scale
degree of the bass, regardless of the chord root. In modern
Roman numeral notation, these annotations would be written
as $\rn{V}\rnsixfive$, $\rn{V}\rnfourthree$, $\rn{V}\rntwo$,
$\rn{V}\rnfourthree$, and $\rn{V}\rnseven$,
respectively][0.75]{primary_sources/hamilton1840cathecism044}

The notational system introduced in
\textcite{weber1817versuch} was not immediately adopted by
other theorists. One of the first adopters was Hamilton, a
British music professor. In the syntax of
\textcite{hamilton1840catechism}, all the scale degrees were
indicated with a single Roman numeral style, regardless of
the chord quality of the triad. That is, although Weber's
notation was partially adopted, this did not include the
notation for major and minor chord qualities. Another
difference is that, in Hamilton's annotations, Roman
numerals indicate melodic scale degrees, instead of chord
roots, as shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/hamilton1840cathecism044}.

Another early adoption of the Roman numeral notation,
arguably the first among the German theorists, was in
\textcite{meister1852vollstandige}. Meister often
accompanied the Roman numeral notation with chord labels and
figured bass indications, as shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/meister1852vollstandige32}.

In order, the subsequent authors who adopted Roman numerals
seem to be Sechter, Richter, Tiersch, and Tracy. Although
\textcite{sechter1853grundsatze} was annotated with mainly
chord labels, the third part of the book (starting on page
98) introduces Roman numerals in the musical examples,
possibly to relate the scale degree of a chord root to
different key contexts. An example is shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/sechter1853grundsatze103}. The Weber
syntax for major and minor chord qualities seems to have
been adopted in \textcite{richter1860lehrbuch}, where also a
single-quote symbol ($\rn{'}$) was introduced to indicate
augmented chords, shown in
\reffig{primary_sources/richter1860lehrbuch34}. The use of
Roman numerals is absent in the earlier treatise of
\textcite{tiersch1868system}. However,  in
\textcite{tiersch1874elementarbuch}, most of the annotations
provided in the musical examples were figured bass or Roman
numeral annotations. \textcite{tracy1878theory} included the
notation with some peculiarities, for example, using a seven
(``$\rn{7}$'') figure for all seventh chords except dominant
seventh chords, which were simply written as $\rn{V}$.

More authors followed in adopting Roman numerals during the
end of the nineteenth century and, by the beginning of the
twentieth century, it was more common than not to observe
\gls{rna} in emerging harmony textbooks. One exception was
among textbooks in French, where figured bass notation
seemed more prominent. A textbook in French by
\textcite{koechlin1928traite} uses Roman numerals
sporadically to indicate scale degrees of the bass note,
shown in \reffig{primary_sources/koechlin1928traite026}.
This practice, which was similar to the one by
\textcite{hamilton1840catechism}, was uncommon by the time
of \textcite{koechlin1928traite}, as most authors then used
Roman numerals to refer to the scale degree of the chord
root, not the bass. This ``archaic'' \gls{rna} practice of
Koechlin might suggest the importance that figured bass
notation had in the French language. In fact, some English
and German books referred to figured bass as the
\emph{French} system.\footnote{For example,
\textcite{norris1894practical}.} Beyond being the preferred
system in French textbooks, figured bass also heavily
influenced the evolution of \gls{rna} in other ways.
