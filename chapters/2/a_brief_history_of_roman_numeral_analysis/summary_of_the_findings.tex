In summary, the survey revealed the following findings:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The role of \textcite{weber1817versuch} in
    defining the basic characteristics of the notation was
    crucial
    \item After \textcite{weber1817versuch}, the Roman
    numeral annotation syntax slowly gained popularity among
    English and German theorists, achieving a more solid
    adoption by the end of the nineteenth century
    \item The Roman numeral notation was often accompanied
    with figured bass. At first, Roman numerals did not
    indicate chord inversions. Later, the practice of
    interconnecting figured bass and Roman numeral
    annotations might have resulted in the notation used
    today to indicate chord inversions with Arabic numerals
    \item Special symbols were introduced for certain
    chords. Notably, \emph{neapolitans} received their own
    symbol (``$\rn{N}$''). Sometimes ``competing'' syntaxes
    were used with the same meaning. For example, some
    authors preferred a single quote ($\rn{'}$) symbol to
    denote augmented triads, whereas others used a plus sign
    (``$\rn{+}$'')\footnote{Nowadays, the second notation is
    more common.}
    \item The treatment of tonicizations was originally
    absent. Any change of key was notated with a colon
    preceded of a new reference key. Eventually, a few ways
    of notating common tonicizations (e.g., \emph{dominant
    of the dominant}) emerged. These evolved into the slash
    syntax we use today, although it is unclear who should
    be credited for the slash notation
    \item Recently, the vocabulary of chords has been
    extended, new additions consider, for example, the
    common-tone diminished seventh, a chord that is often
    written as $\rn{CT}\rndim\rnseven$. This also speaks of
    the continuing evolution of the syntax
\end{enumerate}
