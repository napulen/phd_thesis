The **harm syntax was proposed by David Huron as part of the
Humdrum (**kern) format. This syntax includes a
comprehensive notation of triads, seventh chords, special
chords, and descriptive (arbitrary) chords using Roman
numeral notation. The notation is well documented, although
many aspects of the notation are missing from the
explanations.
