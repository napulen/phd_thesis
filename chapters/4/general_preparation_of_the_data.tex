% \glspl{rna} datasets often  differ in their size, format,
% and musical genre. One of the main characteristics that
% distinguishes them from, for example, chord labeling
% datasets, is that \gls{rna} annotations require a clear
% indication of the local key (see \refsubsec{keyestimation}),
% preferrably with the full Roman numeral annotation in string
% form as described by one of the digital standards (described
% in \refsubsec{symbolicmusicformats}). The string form of the
% Roman numeral is not always provided, and the format of the
% string form in one digital standard is not always comparable
% to the one in another digital standard. However, as long as
% clear indications of local key and chord labels are
% provided, I would consider it a \gls{rna} dataset.
