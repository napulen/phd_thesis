% This is \refsec{dataaugmentation}, which introduces the
% data augmentation.

The annotations in the aggregated dataset account for close
to 100,000 chords. However, these chords are distributed
unevenly, and distributed across different keys. One way to
compensate for the available amount of training data is data
augmentation. One of the most common data-augmentation
approaches for \gls{acr} and \gls{lke} is the use of
transposition. This method is applied to this dataset.

Moreover, an additional method for data augmentation is
described in \refsubsec{synthesisofartificialexamples},
which consists of generating artificial examples from the
chord annotations presented in the dataset.
