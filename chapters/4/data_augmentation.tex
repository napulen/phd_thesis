The annotations in the aggregated dataset account for nearly
105,000 chords. However, the chord classes are imbalanced
and there may not be examples of a chord class across all
the keys in the vocabulary. One way to compensate for this
is by transposing the training examples to different keys,
which is a popular data-augmentation method in \gls{arna},
\gls{acr}, and \gls{gke} research. This method is applied to
the aggregated dataset to increase the number of examples
and balance the distribution of chords across all keys.

In addition to transposition, an additional method for data
augmentation is proposed, which consists of generating
artificial examples from the chord annotations presented in
the dataset. This method is inspired on pedagogical
exercises often found in harmony textbooks.
