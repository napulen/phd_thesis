% This is \refsubsec{haydn``sun''stringquartets(haydnsun)},
% which introduces the haydn ``sun'' string quartets
% (haydnsun).

The \gls{haydnsun} dataset was introduced by
\textcite{napoleslopez2017automatic}. It consists of
annotations for every movement in the string quartets Op. 20
by Haydn (commonly known as the ``Sun'' quartets). The
annotations are written on top of the symbolic music scores
provided at the KernScores library
\parencite{sapp2005online}. The dataset was annotated by
Rafael Caro Repetto and \myself{} for the first movements of
each quartet (6 files), and by \myself{} for all remaining
movements (18 files). The dataset consists of 24 files,
2,921 measures of music, and 5,357 Roman numeral labels.
