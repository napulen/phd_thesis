% This is \refsubsec{haydn``sun''stringquartets(haydnsun)},
% which introduces the haydn ``sun'' string quartets
% (haydnsun).

The \gls{haydnsun} dataset was introduced by
\textcite{napoleslopez2017automatic}. It consists of
annotations for every movement in the ``Sun'' String
Quartets (Op. 20) by Haydn. The annotations are written on
top of the symbolic music scores provided at the KernScores
library \parencite{sapp2005online}. The annotations are in
the \gls{humharm} syntax (see \refsubsec{humdrum(**harm)}).
