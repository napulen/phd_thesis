% This is \refsubsec{beethovenpianosonatas(bps)}, which
% introduces the beethoven piano sonatas (bps).

The \gls{bps} dataset was introduced by
\textcite{chen2018functional}. It consists of annotations
for all the first movements of piano sonatas by Beethoven.
The annotations are provided in a tabular \gls{csv} file
format. The annotations are provided with lists of midi
notes, but not a full symbolic score (e.g., in MusicXML
format). Thus, an external collection of musical scores in
MusicXML format was collected to accompany the annotations
in this research.
