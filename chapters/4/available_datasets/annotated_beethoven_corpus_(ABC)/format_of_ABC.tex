All of the annotations in the \gls{abc} dataset are encoded
in the \gls{dcml} standard for \gls{rna} (see
\refsubsubsec{thedcmlstandard}).

\phdparagraph{Original annotations (version 1)}

In the originally published version of the dataset, each
annotation consists of nine parts, which are parsed using
regular expressions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Key
    \item Pedal note
    \item Roman numeral (numerator)
    \item Chord quality
    \item Numeric inversion
    \item Chord alterations (e.g., added notes)
    \item Roman numeral (denominator)
    \item Pedal ending
    \item Phrase ending
\end{enumerate}

\phdparagraph{Revised annotations (version 2)}

A revision of the \gls{dcml} standard notation (see
\refsubsec{theDCMLstandard}) lead to a new version of this
dataset in 2021. The dataset in the new version,
additionally to the new harmonic analysis standard features,
according to the authors, corrections in the annotations and
additional files.
