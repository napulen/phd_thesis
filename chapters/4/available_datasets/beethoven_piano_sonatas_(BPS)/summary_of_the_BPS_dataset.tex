According to the count performed in this \thesisdiss{}, the
\gls{bps} dataset has a total duration in quarter notes of
23,540, across 7,080 measures. After preprocessing and
preparation, the \gls{abc} dataset contributed 10,584
\gls{rna} chord annotations, which have an average harmonic
rhythm of 2.22 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).
