According to the count performed in this \thesisdiss{}, the
\gls{bps} dataset has a total duration in quarter notes of
23,540, across 7,080 measures. After preprocessing and
preparation, the \gls{bps} dataset contributed 10,584
\gls{rna} chord annotations, which have an average harmonic
rhythm of 2.22 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).

The distribution of the \gls{rna} annotations and their
inversions are shown in \reffig{bps_rn_inversion}. The
\gls{bps} dataset is one of the two datasets (the other one
being \gls{haydnsun}) that do not provide examples of
$\rnCad$ chords. It is unlikely that this means there is no
presence of them, but instead that they have been annotated
as either $\rn{I}\rnsixfour$ or $\rn{V}\rnsixfour$. This is
one of the reasons why the $\rnCad$ symbol is useful,
because then these chords can be disambiguated.
