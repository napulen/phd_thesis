% This is \refsubsubsec{formatofBPS}, which introduces the
% format of BPS.

The annotations of the \gls{bps} dataset are provided in a
tabular \gls{csv} file format. These \gls{csv} files contain
and offset, in 32nd notes from the beginning of the score,
of the location of each chord. The annotations are
accompanied with an accompanying \gls{csv} file provided
containing the midi \gls{midi} notes of the score (in a
similar format for the offsets), but not a full symbolic
score (e.g., in \gls{musicxml} format). Thus, for this
research, it was necessary to find an external collection of
musical scores in \gls{musicxml} format to accompany the
annotations of this dataset.
