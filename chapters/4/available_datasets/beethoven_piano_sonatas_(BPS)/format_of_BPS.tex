% This is \refsubsubsec{formatofBPS}, which introduces the
% format of BPS.

The annotations of the \gls{bps} dataset are provided in a
tabular \gls{csv} file format. These \gls{csv} files contain
an offset, in 32nd notes from the beginning of the score, of
the location of each chord. The annotations are accompanied
by another \gls{csv} file containing the midi
\gls{midi} notes of the score (in a similar format for the
offsets), but not a full symbolic score (e.g., in
\gls{musicxml} format). Thus, for this research, it was
necessary to find an external collection of musical scores
in \gls{musicxml} format to accompany the annotations of
this dataset.
