According to the count performed in this \thesisdiss{}, the
\gls{kmt} dataset has a total duration in quarter notes of
2,107, across 548 measures. After preprocessing and
preparation, the \gls{kmt} dataset contributed 1,415
\gls{rna} chord annotations, which have an average harmonic
rhythm of 1.49 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).

The distribution of the \gls{rna} annotations and their
inversions are shown in \reffig{kmt_rn_inversion}. This
dataset lacks examples of more \gls{rna} classes more than
any other dataset considered. The majority of the
annotations being $\rnI$, $\rni$, $\rnV$, and $\rnVsev$
chords. However, there is a considerable amount of $\rnCad$
annotations and an unusually larger number of
\gls{neapolitan} ($\rnN$) chords. Because of the nature of
this dataset (i.e., examples of modulations in music theory
textbooks), it is possible that the focus of the examples
has been on modulations across different keys, rather than
exotic chord progressions. The distribution of keys shown
below supports this ideas.
