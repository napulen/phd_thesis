According to the count performed in this \thesisdiss{}, the
\gls{haydnsun} dataset has a total duration in quarter notes of
2,107, across 548 measures. After preprocessing and
preparation, the \gls{abc} dataset contributed 1,415
\gls{rna} chord annotations, which have an average harmonic
rhythm of 1.49 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).
