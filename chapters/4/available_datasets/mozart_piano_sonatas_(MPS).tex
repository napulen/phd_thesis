% This is \refsubsec{mozartpianosonatas(mps)}, which
% introduces the mozart piano sonatas (mps).

The \gls{mps} dataset was introduced by
\textcite{hentschel2021annotated}. The dataset consists of
musical scores in MusicXML format, as well as annotations of
the harmony and cadence information. The format of the
annotations is similar to the one in the revised (i.e.,
version 2) \gls{abc} dataset.
