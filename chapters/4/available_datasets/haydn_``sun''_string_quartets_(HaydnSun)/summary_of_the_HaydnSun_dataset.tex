According to the count performed in this \thesisdiss{}, the
\gls{haydnsun} dataset has a total duration in quarter notes of
9,095, across 2,921 measures. After preprocessing and
preparation, the \gls{abc} dataset contributed 5,357
\gls{rna} chord annotations, which have an average harmonic
rhythm of 1.7 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).
