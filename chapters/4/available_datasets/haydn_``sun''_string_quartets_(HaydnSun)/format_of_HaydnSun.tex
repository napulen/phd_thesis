The annotations of the \gls{haydnsun} dataset are provided
in the \gls{humharm} syntax (see
\refsubsubsec{humdrum(**harm)}). This is the same digital
format used by the \gls{tavern} dataset and the first
end-to-end \glspl{rna} system. In addition to the
annotations, a ``description'' field was included in these
files, which provides descriptions for difficult/ambiguous
annotations.
