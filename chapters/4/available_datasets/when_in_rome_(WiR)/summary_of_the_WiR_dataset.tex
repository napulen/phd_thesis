According to the count performed in this \thesisdiss{}, the
\gls{wir} dataset has a total duration in quarter notes of
29,951, across 9,099 measures. After preprocessing and
preparation, the \gls{wir} dataset contributed 17,734
\gls{rna} chord annotations, which have an average harmonic
rhythm of 1.69 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).

The distribution of the \gls{rna} annotations and their
inversions are shown in \reffig{wir_rn_inversion}. This
dataset is one of the two datasets (the other one being
\gls{abc}) that provides at least one example of every Roman
numeral class in the vocabulary. In addition to that, the
\gls{wir} dataset is the only dataset that provides examples
in third inversion of every seventh chord in the vocabulary,
and the only dataset providing examples of any inversions at
all in a $\rnIIIaugsev$ chord.
