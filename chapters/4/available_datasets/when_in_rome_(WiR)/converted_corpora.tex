The datasets that have been converted in the \gls{wir}
dataset include, chronologically, \gls{abc}, \gls{tavern},
and \gls{haydnsun}. The \gls{abc} was converted and manually
corrected by Gotham, which was presented in the first
mention of \gls{wir} \parencite{gotham2019romantext}.
Similarly, \gls{tavern} was converted by Gotham and appended
to the repository. \gls{haydnsun} was converted by
\myself{}, with the purpose of increasing the reach of the
annotations among the users of the \gls{romantext} format.
