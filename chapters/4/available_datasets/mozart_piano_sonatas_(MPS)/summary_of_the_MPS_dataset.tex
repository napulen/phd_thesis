According to the count performed in this \thesisdiss{}, the
\gls{mps} dataset has a total duration in quarter notes of
22,305, across 7,465 measures. After preprocessing and
preparation, the \gls{mps} dataset contributed 15,865
\gls{rna} chord annotations, which have an average harmonic
rhythm of 1.41 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).

The distribution of the \gls{rna} annotations and their
inversions are shown in \reffig{mps_rn_inversion}. In this
dataset, all occurrences of $\rnN$ chords are in first
inversion, which is not the case for any other dataset.
Although this is also the most common occurrence of
\gls{neapolitan} chords, so it is consistent with the
musical practice of the period. The \gls{mps} dataset is
also one of two datasets lacking any examples of $\rnIIIaug$
chords (the other one being \gls{kmt}). Unlike \gls{kmt},
however, \gls{mps} does present examples of $\rnVaug$
chords. This is an interesting case, because a $\rnIIIaug$
chord is an enharmonic of a $\rnVaug$ chord in the same key,
as both are made of the same \gls{pcset} but with different
note spellings. For this reason, when designing the
vocabulary, I decided to make $\rnIIIaug$ an exclusive chord
of the minor mode, and $\rnVaug$ an exclusive chord of the
major mode, so both labels can coexist. What this indicates
here, is that all occurrences of augmented triads found in
\gls{mps} occur in a major-key context, which results in
only $\rnVaug$ labels. Perhaps this suggests that Mozart
only used augmented triads in major keys, although that
musicological claim would require further inspection beyond
the scope of this dissertation. See
\refappendix{amethodforsystematicromannumeralanalysis} for
further discussion on $\rnIIIaug$ and $\rnVaug$ chords.
