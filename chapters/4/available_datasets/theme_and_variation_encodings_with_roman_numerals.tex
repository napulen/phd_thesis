% roman numerals (tavern).

The \gls{tavern} dataset was introduced by
\textcite{devaney2015theme}. This dataset consists of
\gls{rna} annotations for piano theme and variations by
Beethoven and Mozart. The annotations are provided in the
\gls{humharm} format, which accompanies the \gls{humkern}
encodings of the musical scores. Unlike most datasets of
this kind, the \gls{tavern} dataset provides more than one
annotation for each piece. Two expert annotators provided
their harmonic analyses of the same corpus. The dataset
provides both sets of annotations.
