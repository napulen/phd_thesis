According to the count performed in this \thesisdiss{}, the
\gls{tavern} dataset has a total duration in quarter notes
of 40,899, across 15,534 measures. After preprocessing and
preparation, the \gls{abc} dataset contributed 24,544
\gls{rna} chord annotations, which have an average harmonic
rhythm of 1.67 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).

The distribution of the \gls{rna} annotations and their
inversions are shown in \reffig{tavern_rn_inversion}. The
\gls{tavern} dataset is one of the two datasets (the other
one being \gls{abc}) that provide examples of $\rnIIIaugsev$
chords, which are the least common type of chord in the
vocabulary.
