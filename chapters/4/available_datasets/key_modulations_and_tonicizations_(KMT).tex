The \gls{kmt} dataset was introduced in
\textcite{napoleslopez2020local}.

All the labels in the dataset were obtained from the
modulation excerpts of five music theory textbooks:
\textcite{aldwell2019harmony, kostka2008tonal,
reger1904supplement, rimskikorsakov1886practical,
tchaikovsky1872guide}.

The dataset contains, in total, 201 excerpts of music with
annotated modulations and tonicizations. The annotations are
encoded in the form of \gls{rna} annotations of all the
chords in the dataset. 

When the theorists of the original sources provided
\gls{rna} annotations, those were preserved in the digital
transcriptions. Otherwise, N\'apoles L'opez and Feisthauer
provided them. All the annotations related to modulations
were taken exclusively from the textbooks. Tonicizations
rely on the \gls{rna} annotations of the chords and these
were not always provided in the textbooks, therefore, they
were often supplied. For some onsets, multiple key
annotations were provided by the theorists. For these
excerpts, the authors of the dataset encoded the keys in
chronological order.
