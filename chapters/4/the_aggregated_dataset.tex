The ``aggregated'' dataset is the resulting collection of
datapoints after applying the general preparation to each of
the publicly available datasets. When these datasets are
aggregated, the resulting dataset has a total duration in
quarter notes of 175,930, across 58,393 measures. In terms
of annotations, the aggregated dataset has 104,926 \gls{rna}
chord annotations, which have an average harmonic rhythm of
1.68 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).

The distribution of the \gls{rna} annotations and their
inversions are shown in \reffig{aggregated_rn_inversion}.

\phdfigure[All the \gls{rna} labels in the aggregated
dataset. Each bar indicates the counts of the Roman numeral
class in different inversions]{aggregated_rn_inversion}

\phdfigure[All the keys spanned in the aggregated dataset.
For each key, the counts indicate which ones correspond to
modulations (local key regions) and tonicizations
]{aggregated_key_mod_ton}

\reffig{aggregated_key_mod_ton} shows the distribution of
the keys in the aggregated dataset. 

After the data aggregation process, the next step is to
split the data into training, validation, and test sets that
can be used to run supervised learning experiments.
