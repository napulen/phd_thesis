The distribution of the \gls{rna} annotations and their
inversions are shown in \reffig{aggregated_rn_inversion}.

\reffig{aggregated_key_mod_ton} shows the distribution of
the keys in the aggregated dataset. 

% As noted throughout \refsec{availabledatasets}, the
% available datasets for \gls{arna} are encoded in
% different digital formats, which are sometimes very
% different to each other. Because \gls{rna} is not a
% standardized practice across music schools, countries, or
% languages, the distinctions between formats may be beyond
% technical, they might also be musically distinct and
% encode chords using different musical conventions.

% This introduces some problems, both musical and technical,
% which need to be addressed to aggregate all the datasets
% into a unified set.
% \refsubsec{standardizingthenotationbetweendatasets}
% describes in more detail some of the issues to overcome in
% order to aggregate the datasets. Then,
% \refsubsec{data-curationmetrics} describes a solution to
% some of these problems, namely, a set of objective metrics
% that semi-automate the detection, correction, and quality
% assurance of the data.

% After the curation process, the only remaining step is to
% split the data into chunks that can be used for running
% supervised learning experiments. That step is described in
% \refsubsec{generatingtraining,validation,andtestsplits}.
