In tonal music theory courses, exercises like the one shown
in \reffig{hindemith_exercise} are very common.

\phdfigure[Harmony exercise in \textcite{hindemith1943concentrated}, where a student \glspl{realize} the chords indicated by the Roman numerals and durations indicated.]{hindemith_exercise}

data-augmentation technique based on using existing
annotations to \gls{realize} the chords of a generated
musical score.
