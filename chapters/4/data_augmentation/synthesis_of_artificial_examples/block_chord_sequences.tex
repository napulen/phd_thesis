In harmony exercises like the one shown in
\reffig{hindemith_exercise}, the goal is often to
\gls{realize} the chords in a four-part harmonization that
respects the voice-leading rules explained in the textbook.
Although it is technically possible to generate such
harmonizations with awareness of  voice-leading rules, this
is expensive to compute using a rule-based voice-leading
algorithm\footnotelink{https://github.com/napulen/romanyh}
