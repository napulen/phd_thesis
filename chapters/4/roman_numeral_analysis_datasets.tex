Datasets for \glspl{rna} differ, sometimes greatly, in their
size, format, and musical genre. One of the main
characteristics that distinguishes them from, for example,
chord labeling datasets, is that \gls{rna} annotations
require a clear indication of the local key (see
\refsubsec{keyestimation}), preferrably with the full Roman
numeral annotation in string form as per one of the digital
standards (described in \refsubsec{symbolicmusicformats}).
