This chapter introduces the datasets used for this research,
as well as the the data curation and data augmentation
workflows used to process the data.
\refsec{generalpreparationofthedata} describes the general
preprocessing applied to all the datasets utilized, before
aggregating them. \refsec{publiclyavailable} introduces the
publicly available datasets that were aggregated.
\refsec{aggregatingallavailabledatasets} summarizes the size
and \gls{rna} distribution of the aggregated dataset.
\refsec{generatingtraining,validation,andtestsplits}
describes the process to partition the dataset into
training, validation, and test splits.
\refsec{dataaugmentation} introduces the flavors of data
augmentation performed to the original data, notably a new
method based on synthesizing artificial musical scores from
the \gls{rna} annotations.
