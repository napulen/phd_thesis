This chapter introduces the datasets used for this research,
as well as the the data curation and data augmentation
workflows used to process the data.
\refsec{generalpreparationofthedata} describes the general
preprocessing applied to all the datasets utilized, before
aggregating them. \refsec{publiclyavailabledatasets}
introduces the publicly available datasets that were
aggregated. \refsec{theaggregateddataset} summarizes the
size and \gls{rna} distribution of the aggregated dataset.
\refsec{generatingtraining,validation,andtestsplits}
describes the process to partition the dataset into
training, validation, and test splits.
\refsec{dataaugmentation} introduces the flavors of data
augmentation performed to the original data, notably a new
method based on synthesizing musical scores from the
\gls{rna} annotations.
