Once all datasets have been aggregated, standardized, and
split into three sets, the dataset is ready for training the
model and running the experiments.

The last step, described in \refsec{dataaugmentation}, is to
perform data augmentation on the training set.

Before that, in this section, I describe the characteristics
of the aggregated training, validation, and test splits of
the dataset.

\phdfigure[All the \gls{rna} labels taken from the
aggregated dataset. Each bar indicates the counts of the
Roman numeral class in different
inversions]{aggregated_rn_inversion}

\phdfigure[All the keys spanned by the \gls{rna} annotations
of the aggregated dataset. For each key, the counts indicate
which ones correspond to modulations (local key regions) and
tonicizations ]{aggregated_key_mod_ton}
