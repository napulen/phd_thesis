Once all datasets have been aggregated, standardized, and
split into three sets, the dataset is ready for training the
model and running the experiments.

The last step, described in \refsec{dataaugmentation}, is to
perform data augmentation on the training set.

Before that, in this section, I describe the characteristics
of the aggregated training, validation, and test splits of
the dataset.

dataset. Each bar indicates the counts of the Roman numeral
class in different inversions]{aggregated_rn_inversion}



\phdfigure[Intersection between the \gls{pcset}s in this
dataset and the \gls{pcset}s in all other
datasets][0.5]{aggregated_pcset_venn}



\phdfigure[All the keys spanned by the \gls{rna} annotations
of the \gls{aggregated} dataset. For each key, the counts indicate
which ones correspond to modulations (local key regions) and
tonicizations ]{aggregated_key_mod_ton}
