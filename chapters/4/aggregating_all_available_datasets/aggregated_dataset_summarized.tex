Once all datasets have been aggregated, standardized, and
split into three sets, the dataset is ready for training the
model and running the experiments.

The last step, described in \refsec{dataaugmentation}, is to
perform data augmentation on the training set.

Before that, in this section, I describe the characteristics
of the aggregated training, validation, and test splits of
the dataset.
