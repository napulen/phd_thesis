When the annotations and scores are not perfectly aligned,
this results in a very negative effect, where a model learns
the wrong chord associations for a musical context. I found
this one of the most pressing problems to be addressed when
aggregating the available datasets. However, it is also very
difficult to detect.

An initial approach is to verify that the duration and
numbering of a measure matches between the annotation and
score files. If a measure number changes inconsistently
between the two, this might indicate a misalignment.
