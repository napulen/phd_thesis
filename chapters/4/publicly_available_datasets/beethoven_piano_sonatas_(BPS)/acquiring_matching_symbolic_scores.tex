Two sets of symbolic music encodings were considered as a
match for the \gls{bps} annotations, one encoded by the user
\emph{ClassicMan} in the MuseScore community
website\footnotelink{https://musescore.com/user/19710/sets/54311}
and another one encoded by Sapp in the \gls{humkern}
format.\footnotelink{https://github.com/craigsapp/beethoven-piano-sonatas}

Two encodings of the same score can often feature
discrepancies when encoded by different persons, in
different formats, or converted from one format to another
\parencite{napoleslopez2018encoding,
napoleslopez2019effects}. I found that to be the case
between these two sets of scores when they were compared
with each
other.\footnotelink{https://napulen.github.io/beethoven\_piano\_sonatas\_comparison/}

In the end, the set by \emph{ClassicMan} was preferred
because the file format did not require any conversion, and
the measure information was more consistent with the
annotation files.
