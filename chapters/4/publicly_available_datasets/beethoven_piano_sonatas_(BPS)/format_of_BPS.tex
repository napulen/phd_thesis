% This is \refsubsubsec{formatofBPS}, which introduces the
% format of BPS.

The annotations of the \gls{bps} dataset are provided in a
tabular \gls{csv} file format. These \gls{csv} files contain
an offset, in \glspl{16th} notes from the beginning of the
score, of the location of each chord. The annotations are
accompanied by another \gls{csv} file containing the
\gls{midi} notes of the score (in a similar format for the
offsets), but not a full symbolic score (e.g., in
\gls{musicxml} format). Thus, for this research, it was
necessary to find an external collection of musical scores
in \gls{musicxml} format to accompany the annotations of
this dataset. In this dissertation, the scores from the user
\emph{ClassicMan} (who granted direct permission for their
use) in the \emph{MuseScore} community were used as a
pairing for the
annotations.\footnotelink{https://musescore.com/user/19710/sets/54311}
