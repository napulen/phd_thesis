The \gls{abc} dataset was introduced by
\textcite{neuwirth2018annotated}. It is a dataset consisting
of Roman numeral annotations for all string quartets by
Beethoven, except for Op. 133 (``Gro{\ss}e Fuge''), where
the authors claim that contrapuntal principles prevail over
harmony. The corpus of scores was annotated by two of the
co-authors (Neuwirth and Moss), each one annotating half of
the dataset and cross-reviewing the other annotator's work.
Both annotators have a background in Musicology and are
experts in tonal harmony.

The dataset comprises sixteen string quartets. These account
for 70 music files (i.e., string quartet movements), 15,806
measures, 240,462 notes, and 27,962 chord labels, according
to the statistical summary presented by the authors.
