According to the count performed in this \thesisdiss{}, the
\gls{abc} dataset has a total duration in quarter notes of
48,034, across 15,746 measures. After preprocessing and
preparation, the \gls{abc} dataset contributed 29,427
\gls{rna} chord annotations, which have an average harmonic
rhythm of 1.63 quarter notes ($\musQuarter$).

The distribution of the \gls{rna} annotations and their
inversions are shown in \reffig{abc_rn_inversion}. As
expected, all of the $\rnCad$ annotations correspond to a
``second inversion'' position. While not all of the datasets
provide this type of annotation (cadential six-four chords)
this dataset provides nearly 110 examples of them. The
\gls{abc} dataset is also one of the few datasets (the
others being \gls{tavern} and \gls{wir}) that provide
examples of $\rnIIIaugsev$ chords, which is the least common
type of Roman numeral of the vocabulary.

\reffig{abc_key_mod_ton} shows the distribution of the keys
in the \gls{abc} dataset. The dataset spans a total of 36
keys out of the 38 in the vocabulary, making it one of the
datasets with more representation of the keys in the
vocabulary. It is only outnumbered by the \gls{kmt} and
\gls{wir}, which span 37 keys each. Most of the keys in
\gls{abc} lie within the center of the \gls{lineoffifths}
(i.e., few accidentals), as expected. However, there is an
unusually large occurrence of the $\keyDs{}$ key. After closer
inspection, it seems that this resulted from a mislabeled
(long) modulation in Op. 131 No. 7 (around measure 119).
Thus, the high count of $\keyDs{}$ is unjustified. Errors like
this one are occassional in all of the datasets. The
objective metrics help to identify them, but it remains to
be one of most time-consuming issues to address in the
development of an \gls{arna} system. The visualization of
the data, as demonstrated by this example, is also helpful
to find and correct annotation issues.
