All of the annotations in the \gls{abc} dataset are encoded
in the \gls{dcml} standard for \gls{rna} (see
\refsubsubsec{theDCMLstandard}).

\phdparagraph{Original annotations (version 1)}

In the originally published version of the dataset, each
annotation consists of nine parts, which are parsed using
regular expressions: 1) key, 2) pedal note, 3) Roman numeral
(numerator), 4) chord quality, 5) numeric inversion, 6)
chord alterations (e.g., added notes), 7) Roman numeral
(denominator), 8) pedal ending, and 9) phrase ending.

\phdparagraph{Revised annotations (version 2)}

A revision of the \gls{dcml} standard notation (see
\refsubsubsec{theDCMLstandard}) lead to a new version of this
dataset in 2021. The new version of the dataset, in addition
to the new harmonic analysis standard, introduces
corrections in the annotations and additional files.
