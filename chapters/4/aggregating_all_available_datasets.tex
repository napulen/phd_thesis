As noted throughout \refsec{availabledatasets}, the
available datasets for \glspl{rna} are encoded in different
digital formats, which are sometimes very different to each
other. Because \gls{rna} is not a standardized practice
across music schools, countries, or languages, the
distinctions between formats may be beyond technical, they
might also be musically distinct and encode chords using
different musical conventions.

This introduces some problems, both musical and technical,
which need to be addressed to aggregate all the datasets
into a unified set.
\refsubsec{standardizingthenotationbetweendatasets}
describes in more detail some of the issues to overcome in
order to aggregate the datasets. Then,
\refsubsec{data-curationmetrics} describes a solution to
some of these problems, namely, a set of objective metrics
that semi-automate the detection, correction, and quality
assurance of the data.

After the curation process, the only remaining step is to
split the data into chunks that can be used for running
supervised learning experiments. That step is described in
\refsubsec{generatingtraining,validation,andtestsplits}.
