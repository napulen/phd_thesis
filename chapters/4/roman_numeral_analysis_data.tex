\glspl{rna} often  differ in their size, format, and musical
genre. One of the main characteristics that distinguishes
them from, for example, chord labeling datasets, is that
\gls{rna} annotations require a clear indication of the
local key (see \refsubsec{keyestimation}), preferrably with
the full Roman numeral annotation in string form as per one
of the digital standards (described in
\refsubsec{symbolicmusicformats}).
