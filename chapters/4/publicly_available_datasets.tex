There are currently, to the best of my knowledge, eight
\gls{rna} datasets: \gls{abc}, \gls{bps}, \gls{haydnsun},
\gls{hlsd}, \gls{kmt}, \gls{mps}, \gls{tavern}, and
\gls{wir}. All but \gls{hlsd} focusing on music from the
\gls{commonpractice} and annotated by expert human
annotators.\footnote{\gls{hlsd} is a crowdsourced dataset.}

In this section, I describe the datasets focusing on music
from the \gls{commonpractice}, as these can be aggregated
into a unified dataset to train a machine learning model.
