Some of the problems observed when standardizing existing
datasets into the representation used were that: 1) the
annotations and scores were misaligned, 2) several chords
end up being mislabeled (due to errors in the conversion or
errors in the annotations themselves), and 3) the inversions
of the chords were incorrectly indicated.
