Some of the problems observed when standardizing existing
datasets into the representation used were that: 1) the
annotations and scores were misaligned, 2) several chords
were mislabeled (due to errors in the conversion or errors
in the annotations themselves), and 3) the inversions of the
chords were incorrectly annotated.

Reviewing these issues manually requires the inspection of
the musical scores and annotations, which is extremely time
consuming. A semi-automatic workflow facilitated the manual
inspection by pinpointing scores and portions of the score
that were potentially containing errors. This semi-automatic
workflow is based on three objective metrics that I designed
based on the errors that I observed in the data during the
first days of manual inspection.
