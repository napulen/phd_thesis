In summary, each of the publicly available datasets was
standardized to a reduced vocabulary of Roman numerals. This
reduced vocabulary was encoded into a \gls{romantext}
container format, that was independent of the score. In
order to spot errors and misalignments, three common error
patterns were searched across the pairs of \gls{romantext}
and \gls{musicxml} scores. The files with the highest
(worst) scores were reviewed and corrected. This process was
repeated a few times until a satisfactory level of quality
was achieved. The next section describes each of the
publicly available datasets that were aggregated in this
way.
