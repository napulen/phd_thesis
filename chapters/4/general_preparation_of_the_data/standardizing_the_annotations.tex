In order to facilitate the aggregation of all datasets,
\gls{romantext} was chosen as the ``container'' digital
format for all \gls{rna} annotations. However, the
underlying vocabulary of Roman numerals is the one described
in \refsec{thevocabularyofromannumerals}, which consists of
31 classes of Roman numerals. This helps to perform the
supervised learning workflow in a more controlled manner
during training and evaluation.

Regarding \gls{romantext}, there are a few motivations for
choosing it as the container format for all annotation
files:

\begin{enumerate} 
    \item It is a stand-alone format, which does not require
    access to the musical score; this is useful for datasets
    where the scores are not provided, then the annotations
    can be aligned with a third-party score
    \item An existing effort has already been done in the
    \gls{wir} dataset
    \parencite{gotham2019romantext, gotham2022openscore}
    to convert other datasets into \gls{romantext}. Thus,
    taking advantage of that effort is desirable 
    \item The \gls{romantext} has been closely integrated to
    the music21 Python library
    \parencite{cuthbert2010music21}, which is one of the
    most advanced software tools for processing musical
    scores, and facilitates the integration of annotations
    with \gls{musicxml} files, which is the symbolic music
    format of most music scores 
\end{enumerate}

Beyond the conversion to \gls{romantext}, one of the
challenges of aggregating the different datasets is that
errors are introduced at different stages of the process.
For example, when the expert annotators mislabeled a chord,
or when the software translating one digital format to
\gls{romantext} performs a mistranslation. An amount of
effort went into detecting and correcting as many errors as
possible in the data.
