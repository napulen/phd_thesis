In order to facilitate the aggregation of all datasets,
\gls{romantext} was chosen as the ``container'' digital
format for all \gls{rna} annotations. However, the
underlying vocabulary of Roman numerals is the one described
in \refsec{thevocabularyofromannumerals}, which consists of
31 classes of Roman numerals. This helps to perform the
supervised learning workflow in a more controlled manner for
training and evaluation.

% There are two motivations for choosing \gls{romantext} as
% the container format for all annotation files:

% \begin{enumerate} \item An existing effort has been
%     already done in the \gls{wir} dataset
%     \parencite{gotham2019romantext, gotham2022openscore}
%     to convert other datasets into \gls{romantext}. Thus,
%     taking advantage of that effort is desirable \item The
%     \gls{romantext} has been closely integrated to the
%     music21 Python library
%     \parencite{cuthbert2010music21}, which is one of the
%     most advanced software tools for processing musical
%     scores, and facilitates the integration of annotations
%     and \gls{musicxml} files \end{enumerate}

% Some of the problems observed when translating existing
% datasets into this new representation were that: 1) the
% annotations and scores were misaligned, 2) several chords
% end up being mislabeled (due to errors in the conversion
% or errors in the annotation process), and 3) the
% inversions of the chords were incorrectly indicated.
