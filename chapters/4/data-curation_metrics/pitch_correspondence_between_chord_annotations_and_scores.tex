Although the presence of nonchord tones and absence of chord
tones can make it difficult to automatically detect whether
a chord has been mislabeled, there is usually some shared
pitch content between the annotation and the score.

Whenever the correspondence of the pitch content and the
chord annotation is unusually low, this might be an
indication that the chord has been mislabeled. This
objective metric has been designed to detect such instances
(e.g., a $C$ chord has been mislabeled as a $C\sharp$ chord,
which is unambiguosly incorrect).
