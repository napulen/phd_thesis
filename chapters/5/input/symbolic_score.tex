% This is \refsubsec{symbolicscore}, which introduces the
% symbolic score.

As mentioned in \refsubsec{symbolicmusicformats}, there are
several symbolic music formats, which prioritize different
aspects of the musical representation (e.g., engraving,
performance, or pitch information). In practice, some
additional considerations need to be taken into account,
such as the support for a given format and/or the quality of
conversions. Additionally, some formats (e.g., \gls{midi})
lack the minimum information required to encode the
representations needed by the neural network.
