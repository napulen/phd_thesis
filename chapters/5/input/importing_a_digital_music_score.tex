% This is \refsubsec{symbolicscore}, which introduces the
% symbolic score.

As mentioned in \refsubsec{symbolicmusicformats}, there are
several symbolic music formats, which prioritize different
aspects of the musical representation (e.g., engraving,
performance, or pitch information). When an \gls{arna}
system is designed, some considerations about symbolic music
files are important, such as the support for a given format
and/or the quality of conversions. Additionally, some
formats (e.g., \gls{midi}) lack the minimum information
required to encode the representations needed by the neural
network.
