\textcite{micchi2020not} found the spelling of the notes to
be meaningful in their experiments designing an \glspl{rna}
machine learning model. We followed a similar approach in
\textcite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet}. Thus, pitch
spelling is an expected property of the inputs processed by
this end-to-end system. For that reason, \gls{midi} files
are not acceptable inputs.
