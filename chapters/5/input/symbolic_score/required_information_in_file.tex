\textcite{micchi2020not} found that the spelling of the
notes was meaningful in their proposed \gls{arna} machine
learning model. We followed a similar approach in
\textcite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet}. Thus, in the
proposed system here, pitch spelling is also an expected
property of the inputs. For that reason, \gls{midi} files
are not acceptable inputs.
