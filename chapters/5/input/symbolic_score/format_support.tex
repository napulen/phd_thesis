% This is \refsubsubsec{formatsupport}, which introduces the
% format support.

Unfortunately, converting and aggregating dataset of varying
formats and annotated by a different person often leads to
discrepancies and misrepresentation in digital systems
\parencite{napoleslopez2018encoding,
napoleslopez2019effects}. In this project, the music21
Python library \parencite{cuthbert2010music21} was used to
process incoming symbolic music files. The support for some
formats (e.g., \gls{mei}) is currently inadequate for
guaranteeing that the score representation will be properly
imported. Thus, the allowed inputs are restricted to
\gls{musicxml} and \gls{humkern} symbolic music formats.
