As mentioned in \refsubsec{samplingofthescore}, the score in
the symbolic music file is stripped from some of its
original information when it is encoded for the neural
network model. Furthermore, the score is sampled at regular
note intervals of 32nd notes, encoding the pitch content at
each of those timesteps. This section describes the method
for encoding the pitch content of each of those timesteps. 

Most symbolic music analysis models collapse different
spellings of the same note, such that 

$$F\sharp = G\flat$$

in this representation, however, pitch spelling is encoded
and taken into account. The easiest method for encoding
pitch spelling is to use one dimension of the timestep
vector to encode each spelling. This method has been used in
\textcite{micchi2020not, micchi2021deep}. An alternative
method, proposed here, is to encode the pitch class and
spelling of the pitch class. Both methods are described
next.
