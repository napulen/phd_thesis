One of the problems of the 35 one-hot encoding of spelled
pitch classes is that the representation cannot encode any
notes beyond two flats or two sharps. Additionally, the
resulting vector is almost three times larger than a similar
vector encoding pitch classes without spelling (12
features).

The representation proposed here reduces some of these
problems. When a enharmonic equivalence is assumed, there is
usually a set of 12 pitch classes used to represent all the
chromatic notes of a Western scale. In addition to this set,
known as ``pitch classes'', notes with a spelling have a
corresponding letter (e.g., $C\sharp$ is pitch class 1, with
the name $C$). Using this information, a pitch class vector
can be complemented with the note letter representation of a
particular note. This results in 19 features (12 pitch
classes, plus 7 note letter names).
