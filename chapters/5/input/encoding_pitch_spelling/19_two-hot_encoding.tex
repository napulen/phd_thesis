One of the problems with the previous representation of 35
features is that the it cannot encode any notes beyond two
flats or two sharps. Additionally, the resulting vector is
almost three times larger than the common representation
based on pitch classes, which has 12 features:

\begin{equation}
    \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}
\end{equation}

The representation proposed here reduces some of the
problems with the representation of 35 features. Instead of
encoding sharps and flats explicitly, it extends the vector
pitch class representation, by also encoding the generic
note letter name:

\begin{equation}
    \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \cup \{C, D, E, F, G, A, B\}
\end{equation}

When an enharmonic equivalence is assumed, there is usually
a set of 12 pitch classes used to represent all the
chromatic notes of a Western scale. In addition to this set,
known as ``pitch classes'', notes with a spelling have a
corresponding letter (e.g., $C\sharp$ is pitch class 1, with
the name $C$). Using this information, a pitch class vector
can be complemented with the note letter representation of a
particular note. This results in 19 features (12 pitch
classes, plus 7 note letter names).
