When two spellings of the same \gls{midi} note number are
distinguished, they can be encoded as different dimensions
in a vector. The use of sharp ($\musSharp$) and flat ($\flat$)
accidentals is very common. The use of double sharp ($x$)
and double flat ($\flat\flat$) accidentals is less common.
Any accidentals beyond two sharps or flats are rare. Thus, a
reasonable representation for spelled pitch
classes\footnote{Note that the octave is ignored.} is a
representation with 35 features.
