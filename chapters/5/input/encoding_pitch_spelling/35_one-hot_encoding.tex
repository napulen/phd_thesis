When two spellings of the same \gls{midi} note number are
distinguished, they can be encoded as different dimensions
in a vector. The use of sharp (\musSharp{}) and flat
(\musFlat{}) accidentals is very common. The use of double
sharp (\musDoubleSharp{}) and double flat (\musDoubleFlat{})
accidentals is less common. Any accidental $a$ such that $x
> \musDoubleSharp{}$ or $a < \musDoubleFlat{}$ is rare.
Thus, a reasonable representation for spelled pitch
classes\footnote{Note that the octave is ignored.} is a
representation with 35 features.
