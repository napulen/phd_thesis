When two spellings of the same \gls{midi} note number are
distinguished, they can be encoded as different dimensions
in a vector. The use of sharp ($\sharp$) and flat ($\flat$)
accidentals is very common. The use of double sharp
($\doublesharp$) and double flat ($\flat\flat$) accidentals
is less common. Any accidentals beyond two sharps or flats
are rare. Thus, a reasonable representation for spelled
pitch classes\footnote{Note that the octave is ignored.} is
a representation with 35 features.
