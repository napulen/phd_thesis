When two spellings of the same \gls{midi} note number are
distinguished, they can be encoded as different dimensions
in a vector. The use of sharp (\musSharp{}) and flat
(\musFlat{}) accidentals is very common. The use of double
sharp (\musDoubleSharp{}) and double flat (\musDoubleFlat{})
accidentals is less common. Any accidental sharper than
\musDoubleSharp{} or flatter than \musDoubleFlat{} is rare.
Thus, a reasonable representation for spelled pitch
classes\footnote{Note that the octave is ignored.} is a
representation with 35 features: $(\musDoubleFlat{},
\musFlat{}, \musNatural{}, \musSharp{}, \musDoubleSharp{})
\times (C, D, E, F, G, A, B)$
