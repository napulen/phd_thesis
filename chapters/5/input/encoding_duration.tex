A representation for note duration is often needed in inputs
and output representations of the neural network. For
example, in the \gls{duration14} input representation (see
\refsubsec{Duration14}) or the \gls{harmonicrhythm7} output
representation (see \refsubsubsec{HarmonicRhythm7}). In
order to encode this kind of information, the following
representation is proposed, with 7 features.

\begin{equation}
    \{\varnothing,\; \musThirtySecond,\; \musSixteenth,\; \musEighth,\; 
    \musQuarter,\; \musHalf,\; \musWhole \}
\end{equation}

In this representation, $\varnothing$ often represents an
\emph{onset}, and each of the subsequent classes represents
the time elapsed since the onset, measured in note
durations, although the specific use varies in each
representation. These cases will be discussed more in detail
in \refsubsec{Duration14} and
\refsubsubsec{HarmonicRhythm7}.
