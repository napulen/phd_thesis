A representation for note duration is often needed in inputs
and output representations of the neural network. For
example, in the \gls{duration14} input representation (see
\refsubsec{Duration14}) or the \gls{harmonicrhythm7} output
representation (see \refsubsubsec{HarmonicRhythm7}). In
order to encode this kind of information, the following
representation is proposed, with 7 features.

\begin{equation}
    \{\varnothing,\; \musThirtySecond,\; \musSixteenth,\; \musEighth,\; 
    \musQuarter,\; \musHalf,\; \musWhole \}
\end{equation}

In this representation, $\varnothing$ describes an
\emph{onset}, and each of the subsequent classes represents
the time elapsed since the onset, measured in note
durations. This convention is used to quantify the time
elapsed since a measure and note onset (see
\refsubsec{measureandnoteonsets}) and the time elapsed since
a \gls{rna} label (see \refsubsubsec{HarmonicRhythm7}).
These cases will be discussed more in detail in
\refsubsec{Duration14} and \refsubsubsec{HarmonicRhythm7}.
