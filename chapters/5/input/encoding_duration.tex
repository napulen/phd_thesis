A representation for metrical information is also proposed.
This representation consists of an encoding of different
note duration values: 1) onset, 2) 32nd note, 3) 16th note,
4) eighth note, 5) quarter note, 6) half note, 7) whole
note. Using these in different ways, they can represent the
encodings of \gls{duration14} and \gls{harmonicrhythm7}.
