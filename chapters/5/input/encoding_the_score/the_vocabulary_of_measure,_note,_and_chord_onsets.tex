A way to encode onsets is often needed in inputs and outputs
of an \gls{arna} model. For example, to indicate where a
measure, note, or chord begins. 
% In the \gls{duration14}
% input representation (see
% \refsubsubsec{measureandnoteonsets}) or the
% \gls{harmonicrhythm7} output representation (see
% \refsubsubsec{HarmonicRhythm7}). 
In order to encode this
kind of information, the following representation is
proposed, with 7 features.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:onset_7}
    \setonset = \{\varnothing,\; \musThirtySecond,\; \musSixteenth,\; 
    \musEighth,\; \musQuarter,\; \musHalf,\; \musWhole \}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:onset_7_magnitude}
    | \setonset | = 7
\end{equation}

In this representation, $\varnothing$ describes an
\emph{onset}, and each of the subsequent classes represents
the time elapsed since the onset, measured in note
durations. In the input, the representation is used to
encode measure and note onsets (see
\refsubsubsec{measureandnoteonsets}). In the output, it is
used to predict the onset of \gls{rna} labels (see
\refsubsubsec{HarmonicRhythm7}). These cases will be
discussed more in detail in
\refsubsubsec{measureandnoteonsets} and
\refsubsubsec{HarmonicRhythm7}.
