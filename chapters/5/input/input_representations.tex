Using the fixed-length sequences and the vocabularies of
pitch spelling (see
\refsubsubsec{thevocabularyofnoteswithspelling}) and onsets
(see
\refsubsubsec{thevocabularyofmeasure,note,andchordonsets}),
the score can be encoded into a set of three \emph{input
representations}, which are dispatched to the trainable
layers of the neural network. These input representations
are the lowest-sounding pitch of a timestep (\gls{bass19}),
all-sounding pitches of each timestep (\gls{chroma19}), and
the measure-and-note onsets (\gls{duration14}).
