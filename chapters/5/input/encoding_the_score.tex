The steps in the previous sections describe the methods to
reduce a symbolic music file into a fixed-length sequence of
pitch values. As mentioned in
\refsubsec{samplingofthescore}, the score in the symbolic
music file is stripped from some of its original information
when it is encoded for the neural network model.
Furthermore, the score is sampled at regular note intervals
of \gls{32nd} notes, encoding the musical information at
each of those timesteps. The encoding of the score occurs in
what I refer to \emph{input representations}, which are
described in \refsubsec{inputrepresentations}. However,
these representations require a numerical representation of
pitch spellings and onsets. Thus, the vocabularies to describe pitch spellings and onsets are introduced here.

% The corresponding encodings are shown in
% \reffig{bass_chroma_separation}.

% classes) sounding at a given time]{bass_chroma_separation}
