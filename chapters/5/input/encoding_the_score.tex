The steps in the previous sections describe the methods to
reduce a symbolic music file into a fixed-length sequence of
pitch values. As mentioned in
\refsubsec{samplingofthescore}, the score in the symbolic
music file is stripped from some of its original information
when it is encoded for the neural network model.
Furthermore, the score is sampled at regular note intervals
of \gls{32nd} notes, encoding the musical information at
each of those timesteps. The encoding dispatched to the
neural networks takes the form of three \emph{input
representations}, which are described in
\refsubsec{inputrepresentations}. However, these
representations require a numerical encoding of pitch
spellings and onsets. Thus, the vocabularies to encode pitch
spellings and onsets are introduced here.
