The steps in the previous sections describe the methods to
reduce a symbolic music file into a fixed-length sequence of
pitch values As mentioned in \refsubsec{samplingofthescore},
the score in the symbolic music file is stripped from some
of its original information when it is encoded for the
neural network model. Furthermore, the score is sampled at
regular note intervals of \gls{32nd} notes, encoding the
musical information at each of those timesteps. This section
describes this encoding process.

Using these sequences and the vocabularies described in
\refsec{thevocabularyofnoteswithspelling} and
\refsec{thevocabularyofmeasure,note,andchordonsets}, the
score can be encoded into a set of \emph{input
representations}, which are dispatched to the trainable
layers of the neural network.

The system currently considers three input representations,
\gls{bass19}, \gls{chroma19}, and \gls{duration14},
described below.

% The corresponding encodings are shown in
% \reffig{bass_chroma_separation}.
