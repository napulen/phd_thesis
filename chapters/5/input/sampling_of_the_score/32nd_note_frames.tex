Following the practice of \textcite{micchi2020not}, the 32nd
note was taken as the reference value used to sample the
input score. Looking at a distribution of note durations
across the dataset, duration values shorter than a 32nd note
are rare. The majority of the note durations being 16th
notes, as shown in \reffig{duration_distribution}.

\phdfigure[Distribution of duration values across the
aggregated dataset. The durations are indicated in
quarter-note multiples. Thus, a 32nd note, the sampling
reference is indicated as a duration of 0.125 quarter
notes.]{duration_distribution}
