Following the practice of \textcite{micchi2020not}, the
\glspl{32nd} note was taken as the reference value used to
sample the input score. One drawback of this sampling method
and reference value is that most tuplets and notes shorter
than a \glspl{32nd} cannot be appropriately encoded. These
note durations are thus approximated. However, looking at a
distribution of note durations across the dataset, duration
values shorter than a \glspl{32nd} note are rare. The
majority of the note durations being \glspl{16th} notes, as
shown in \reffig{duration_distribution}. 

\phdfigure[Distribution of duration values across the
training portion of the aggregated dataset. The durations
are indicated in multiples of a \glspl{quarter} note. Thus,
