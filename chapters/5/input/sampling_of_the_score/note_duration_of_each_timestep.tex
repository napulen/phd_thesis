Following the practice of \textcite{micchi2020not}, the
\glspl{32nd} note was taken as the reference value used to
sample the input score. Looking at a distribution of note
durations across the dataset, duration values shorter than a
\glspl{32nd} note are rare. The majority of the note
durations being \glspl{16th} notes, as shown in
\reffig{duration_distribution}. Using this sampling method
and reference value, notice that most tuplets and notes
shorter than a \glspl{32nd} cannot be fully encoded. Notes
with these duration values are approximated. This
approximation is similar to the way a waveform is
approximated when it is digitized.
