Following the practice of \textcite{micchi2020not}, the
32\textsuperscript{nd} note was taken as the reference value
used to sample the input score. Looking at a distribution of
note durations across the dataset, duration values shorter
than a 32\textsuperscript{nd} note are rare. The majority of
the note durations being 16\textsuperscript{th} notes, as
shown in \reffig{duration_distribution}.

\phdfigure[Distribution of duration values across the
training portion of the aggregated dataset. The durations
are indicated in multiples of a quarter note
(\musQuarter{}). Thus, the sampling reference
\musThirtySecond{} is indicated as a duration of 0.125
quarter notes]{duration_distribution}
