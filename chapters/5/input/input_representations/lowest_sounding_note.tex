The first input representation, \gls{bass19}, encodes the
lowest-sounding note at each timestep. The encoding of pitch
spelling is done using the method based on duples of pitch
class and generic note letters, introduced in
\refsubsubsec{encodingnoteswithspelling}. When this encoding
strategy is applied, it results in a two-hot encoded vector
like the one shown in \reffig{bass_encoding}.
