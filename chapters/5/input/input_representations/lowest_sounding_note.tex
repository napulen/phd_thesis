The first input representation, \gls{bass19}, encodes the
lowest-sounding note at each timestep. The encoding is done
using the pitch spelling representation discussed in
\refsubsubsec{encodingpitchspelling}. When this encoding
strategy is applied, it results in a two-hot encoded vector
like the one shown in \reffig{bass_encoding}.
