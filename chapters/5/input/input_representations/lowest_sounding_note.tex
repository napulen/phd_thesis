The first input representation, \gls{bass19}, encodes the
lowest-sounding note at each timestep. The encoding of the
bass input is done using the pitch spelling representation
discussed in \refsubsubsec{19two-hotencoding}. When this
encoding strategy is applied, it results in a one-hot
encoded vector like the one shown in \reffig{bass_encoding}.
