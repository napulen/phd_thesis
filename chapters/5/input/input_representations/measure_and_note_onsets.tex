The encoding process of pitch in the \gls{bass19} and
\gls{chroma19} input representations will not take into
account any information about note onsets, measures, or
metrical structure. In order to compensate for that, a third
input representation, \gls{duration14}, is introduced to
process measure and note onsets. The process for encoding
the onsets utilizes a stack of two multi-hot duration
vectors (see \refsubsec{encodingduration}), one for the
onset of measures, and one for the onset of notes.
\reffig{duration_encoding} shows an example of the
representation.

representation]{duration_encoding}

After the three input representations are encoded for all
the 640 timesteps, the resulting tensors are dispatched to
the trainable layers of the neural network.
