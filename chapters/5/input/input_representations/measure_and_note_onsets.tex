The encoding of pitch information in the \gls{bass19} and
\gls{chroma19} input representations does not take into
account any information about note onsets, measures, or
metrical structure. In order to compensate for that, a third
input representation, \gls{duration14}, is introduced to
process measure and note onsets. The process for encoding
the onsets utilizes two 7-dimensional vectors, one for the
onset of measures, and one for the onset of notes (see
\refsubsec{encodingduration}). \reffig{duration_encoding}
shows an example of the representation.

After the three input representations are encoded for all
the 640 timesteps, the resulting encoded sequences are
dispatched to the trainable layers of the neural network.
