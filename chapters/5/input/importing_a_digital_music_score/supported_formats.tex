Unfortunately, aggregating datasets of various symbolic
music formats (and annotated by different people) often
leads to discrepancies and misrepresentation in digital
systems \parencite{napoleslopez2018encoding,
napoleslopez2019effects}. In the \gls{arna} model proposed
here, the \emph{music21} Python library
\parencite{cuthbert2010music21} was used to process incoming
symbolic music files. The support for some formats (e.g.,
\gls{mei}) is currently inadequate for guaranteeing that the
score representation will be properly imported. Furthermore,
\textcite{micchi2020not} found that the spelling of the
notes was meaningful in their proposed \gls{arna} machine
learning model. We followed a similar approach in
\textcite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet}. Thus, in the
proposed system here, pitch spelling is also an expected
property of the inputs. For that reason, \gls{midi} files
are not acceptable inputs. Thus, the allowed inputs are
restricted to \gls{musicxml} and \gls{humkern} symbolic
music formats.
