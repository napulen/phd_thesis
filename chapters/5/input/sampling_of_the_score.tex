Neural network models often work with a reduced
representation of the original input (e.g., images of lower
resolution, audio files of lower sampling rates than
average, etc.)

This is also the case for the information contained in a
musical score. A symbolic music file may include
articulations, dynamics, tempo, beaming, and other
characteristics of the notation. Most of this information is
stripped away from the encoded representation sent to the
neural network model. In particular, the encoding of the
score is limited to fragments of music of fixed length and sampled at regularly-spaced note durations.
