Neural network models often work with a lossy representation
of the original input. For example, by lowering the original
resolution of an image or the sampling rate of an audio
file.

This is also the case in symbolic music scores. A symbolic
music file often includes characteristics of the music
notation, such as articulations, dynamics, tempo, beaming,
and stem directions. However, this information is frequently
removed from the encoded representation sent to a neural
network model. In the proposed system, the encoding of the
score is limited to fragments of music of fixed length and
sampled at regularly-spaced note durations.
