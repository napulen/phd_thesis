Neural network models often work with a lossy representation
of the original input (e.g., lowering the original
resolution of images, lowering the original sampling rate of
an audio file, etc.)

This is also the case for the information contained in a
musical score. A symbolic music file may include
characteristics of the music notation, such as
articulations, dynamics, tempo, beaming, and others.
However, this information is often stripped away from the
encoded representation sent to the neural network model. In
the proposed system, the encoding of the score is limited to
fragments of music of fixed length and sampled at
regularly-spaced note durations.
