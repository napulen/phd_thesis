Neural network models often work with a lossy representation
of the original input. For example, by lowering the original
resolution of an image or the sampling rate of an audio
file.

This is also the case in symbolic music scores. A symbolic
music file often includes characteristics of the music
notation, such as articulations, dynamics, tempo, beaming,
and stem directions. However, this information is frequently
removed from the encoded representation sent to a neural
network model.\footnote{Notice that this does not
necessarily mean that such information is detrimental to the
model. Most likely, the omission of this information is
related with lowering the trainable parameters of the
network, as well as decreasing the effort of data curation.}
In the proposed system, the encoding of the score is limited
to fragments of music of fixed length and sampled at
regularly-spaced note durations.
