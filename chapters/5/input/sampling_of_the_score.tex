Neural network models often work with a lossy representation
of the original input (e.g., lowering the original
resolution of images, lowering the original sampling rate of
an audio file, etc.)

This is also the case for the information contained in a
musical score. A symbolic music file may include
articulations, dynamics, tempo, beaming, and other
characteristics of the notation. Most of this information is
stripped away from the encoded representation sent to the
neural network model. In particular, the encoding of the
score is limited to fragments of music of fixed length and
sampled at regularly-spaced note durations.
