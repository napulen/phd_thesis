For the following example, assume that the \gls{mtl}
configuration provides the following outputs only:
\gls{harmonicrhythm7}, \gls{localkey38}, and \gls{pcset121}.
Using these three predictions, a \gls{rna} label can be
generated with the help of the \algorithmrn{} algorithm.

The \gls{pcset} $\elpcsetpred$ corresponds to the prediction
of the \gls{pcset121} classifier, the key $\elkeypred$ is
the prediction of the \gls{localkey38 classifier}, and the
onsets $\elonsetpred \in \setonset$ are used to filter the
timesteps where \gls{rna} labels need to be generated.
