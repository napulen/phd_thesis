The different components of the \gls{rna} string have a
hierarchical structure. The tonicization $\eldenpred$ is
relative to the key $\elkeypred$. The numerator $\elnumpred$
is relative to the tonicized key $\eldenpred$. The inversion
$\elinvpred$ relies on the bass note (\gls{bass35}) in the
context of the chord of the numerator $\elnumpred$. Taking
the hierarchical structure into account, the components of
the \gls{rna} label need to be resolved in the following
way:

\begin{enumerate} 
    \item The key $\elkeypred$ is taken directly from the
    \gls{localkey38} classifier 
    \item The tonicization $\eldenpred$ is a key prediction
    from \gls{tonicization38}, but needs to be encoded as a
    relative scale degree of the key $\elkeypred$
    \item The numerator $\elnumpred$ is a chord resolved
    from the key of the tonization $\eldenpred$ 
    \item The inversion $\elinvpred$ is a stack of Arabic
    numerals determined from the position of the bass note
    \gls{bass35} in the chord implied by $\elnum$ and
    whether $\elnum$ is a triad or seventh chord
\end{enumerate}

\phdparagraph{encoding the tonicization}

The tonicization is encoded as a scale degree relative to
the key $\elkeypred$, as shown in
\reftab{directmethod_rna_tonicization}.
