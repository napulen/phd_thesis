The different components of the \gls{rna} string have a
hierarchical structure. The tonicization $\elden$ is
relative to the key $\elkey$. The numerator $\elnum$ is
relative to the tonicized key $\elden$. The inversion
$\elinv$ depends on the numerator $\elnum$, because the
syntax of the inversion is different for triads and for
seventh chords. Taking the hierarchical structure into
account, the components of the \gls{rna} label need to be
resolved in the following order:

\begin{enumerate} 
    \item Key $\elkey$ 
    \item Tonicization $\elden$ 
    \item Numerator $\elnum$ 
    \item Inversion $\elinv$ 
\end{enumerate}
