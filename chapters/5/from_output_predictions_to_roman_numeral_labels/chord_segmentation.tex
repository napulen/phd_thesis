Consider the predictions in \reftab{crnn_predictions}. As
expected, the \gls{crnn} will provide predictions every
\gls{32nd} note, however, most of these timesteps should not
be considered \gls{rna} labels. Therefore, the chord segmentation of the chords should be This requires an approach
for chord segmentation, where the onset predictions
$\elonset \in \setonset$ starting from the predictions of
the \gls{crnn} is to decide the chord segmentation. That is,
which of the 640 timesteps should be considered the location
of a \gls{rna} label. This is the first problem to be
solved.
