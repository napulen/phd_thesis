In addition to the direct method that can be used with the
\gls{mtl} predictions of this model, it might be useful to
generate Roman numeral labels when only a chord label and
key are provided. Some methods, for example, the one in
\textcite{mcleod2021modular}, produce chord labels and keys,
thus a numerator $\elnum$ and a tonicization $\elden$ need
to be estimated from the chord label and key. In that
situation, an alternative method is provided, based on the
\algorithmrn{} algorithm, described in
\refsec{analgorithmtoresolveromannumeralsfromapitch-classsetandkey}.
This was the method used to estimate full \gls{rna} labels
from the predictions of the model in
\textcite{mcleod2021modular, chen2021attend} during the
evaluation (which is explained in
\refsec{evaluationagainstpreviousmodels})
