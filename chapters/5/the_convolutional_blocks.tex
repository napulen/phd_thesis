The first trainable layers of the \gls{crnn} are
convolutional layers. The network begins by processing each
input representation in its own convolutional block, and
concatenating the resulting outputs, as shown in
\reffig{concatenated_blocks}.

consisting of three convolutional blocks that process each
of the input representations
