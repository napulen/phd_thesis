The first trainable layers of the \gls{crnn} are the
convolutional ones. The network begins by processing each
input representation in its own convolutional block, and
concatenating the resulting outputs, as shown in
\reffig{concatenated_blocks}. Each of the convolutional
blocks comprises a sequence of 1D convolutional layers.
