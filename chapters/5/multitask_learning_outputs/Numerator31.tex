In a similar way than \gls{pcset121}, the \gls{rn31} task is
also a generated vocabulary of chords. This task is
equivalent to the \emph{primary degree} (see
\refsubsubsec{primarydegree}). However, as there is no
``secondary degree'' (which has been replaced by the
\gls{tonicization38} task), the name ``Roman numeral
numerator'' was chosen, alluding also to the fact that
secondary degrees are related to the ``fraction'' notation
employed in \gls{rna} to indicate tonicizations.

The task is constrained to only 31 classes. In
\parencite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet}, the number of
Roman numeral numerators was left unbounded during data
preprocessing. The same paper also discussed that a subset
of 75 classes spanned ~98\% of the annotations found in the
training set. Here, that number has been constrained
further, to allow only 31 possible Roman numeral classes.
