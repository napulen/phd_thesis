The \gls{localkey38} represents the key segmentations of the
piece, such that a given timestep is interpreted in terms of
the \gls{localkey38} in turn. 
% This is equivalent to the local key (see
% \refsubsubsec{localkey}) in other approaches.
The vocabulary of keys, $\setkey$ (see
\refsec{thevocabularyofmusicalkeys}), comprises 38 classes.
The 38 classes are the result of inspecting all the
modulations and tonicizations across the aggregated training
set.
