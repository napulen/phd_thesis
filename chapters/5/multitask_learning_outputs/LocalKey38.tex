The \gls{localkey38} is a classification task that predicts
the $\elkey$ component of a \gls{rna} annotation. It uses
the $\setkey$ vocabulary.


% represents the key segmentations of the piece, such that a
% given timestep is interpreted in terms of the
% \gls{localkey38} in turn. % This is equivalent to the
% local key (see % \refsubsubsec{localkey}) in other
% approaches. The vocabulary of keys, $\setkey$ (see
% \refsec{thevocabularyofmusicalkeys}), comprises 38
% classes. The 38 classes are the result of inspecting all
% the modulations and tonicizations across the aggregated
% training set.
