The \gls{bass35} class represents the chord tone acting as
the bass. Pitches of up to two flats and two sharps are
possible output classes. Notice that throughout this
\thesisdiss{}, the ``bass'' is considered a perceptual
phenomenon, which might not correspond with the lowest
sounding note encoded as input representation \gls{bass19}.
\reffig{bass_encoding} is a good example of this situation.
In the original score, the two-voice pattern of the bass in
the measures 1 and 2 could easily persuade the listener to
think that the lower G note is the bass throughout measure
3, however, it is only the lowest-sounding note during the
first eighth note. Thus, the \emph{bass} always refers to
the lowest note of the annotated chord.

The first four output representations, \gls{bass35},
\gls{tenor35}, \gls{alto35}, and \gls{soprano35}, are all
related to the realization of the annotated chord in a
\gls{closed-position}. \reffig{satb_all} shows the
realization of the annotated chords that defines the target
class of each classifier. \reffig{satb_bass} shows an
example of the \gls{bass35} target label for this fragment
of music.
