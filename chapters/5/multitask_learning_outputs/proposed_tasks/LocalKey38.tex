The \gls{localkey38} represents the key segmentations of the
piece, such that a given timestep is interpreted in terms of
the \gls{localkey38} in turn. This is equivalent to the
local key (see \refsubsubsec{localkey}) in other approaches.

The main difference between previous approaches is the
larger number of classes in the representation proposed
here. The 38 classes are the result of inspecting all the
modulations and tonicizations across the aggregated training
set. Based on this exploration, the furthest key in the
\emph{line-of-fifths} \parencite{temperley2000line} was used
as the boundary of vocabulary and extended to its equivalent
in the ``flat'' side of the \emph{line-of-fifths}.
