The last task classification task is the
\gls{harmonicrhythm7}. One of the main problems of the
\gls{mtl} configuration, especially with the larger number
of tasks proposed here, is that it is difficult to resolve
the segmentation of the chord labels, because the different
classifiers may segment the score differently (e.g., the
\gls{pcset121} predicts that there's a chord change, but the
\gls{rn31} does not).

There have been multiple solutions proposed to deal with
this problem. \textcite{chen2021attend} explored a different
neural network architecture and metrics to improve the
segmentation, \textcite{micchi2021deep} proposed a
\gls{nade} layer to model the interdependency of the
different classification tasks, \textcite{mcleod2021modular}
and  \textcite{wu2021melody} tackled the problem of chord
segmentation (harmonic rhythm) by implementing dedicated
models. 

Here, another multiclass classifcation problem is proposed
instead. This has the advantage that its implementation is
much simpler than a dedicated model, and the training can be
done jointly with the other tasks in an end-to-end fashion.

The encoding of the \gls{harmonicrhythm7} is based on the
method for encoding onsets described in
\refsubsubsec{encodingmeasure,note,andchordonsets}.

% The overhead in the time it takes to train the network is
% negligible and, more importantly, it does not seem to be
% detrimental to the other classifcation problems. On the
% contrary, it seems to improve the overall segmentation of
% the other tasks, possibly because the network learns
% representations that minimize the loss across all the
% tasks, including the chord segmentation (harmonic rhythm).

% Initially, this problem was addressed in
% \textcite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet} as a binary
% classification problem, where timesteps that coincided
% with a chord onset were marked as 1s and the remaining
% timesteps as 0s.

% However, this approach lead to a highly imbalanced
% distribution of classes, a recurring problem that has been
% important in other tasks. In order to compensate for the
% imbalanced distribution of classes, an alternative method
% is proposed, based on 7 classes. The task of harmonic
% rhythm is now phrased as ``annotate the duration elapsed
% since the last chord''. This encoding makes use of the
% duration encoding mentioned in
\refsubsubsec{encodingmeasure,note,andchordonsets}.
