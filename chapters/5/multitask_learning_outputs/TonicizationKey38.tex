In previous methods, such as \textcite{chen2018functional,
chen2019harmony, micchi2020not, micchi2021deep,
mcleod2021modular} there is generally only one ``Key'' task
to solve by the machine learning model. Applied chords and
other fluctuations of key are handled either by a
``secondary degree'' task \parencite{chen2021attend,
micchi2021deep} or not handled at all
\parencite{mcleod2021modular}.

In the proposed tasks of this dissertation, an alternative
approach is proposed based on two layers of key analysis.
The \gls{localkey38} task represents the key of a region of
music. By default, any Roman numeral label is interpreted in
reference to the \gls{localkey38}. However, for cases of
tonicization, a different key is encoded. The scope of a
tonicization key is always the current timestep, and it is
considered an instantaneous fluctuation of key (i.e., it
does not affect future timesteps). This other task is
referred as the \gls{tonicization38}. The vocabulary of keys
is the same one used for \gls{localkey38}, $\vocabkey$.
