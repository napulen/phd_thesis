% This is \refsec{input}, which introduces the input.

The goal of this system is to process any symbolic music
files provided as input, annotating them with Roman numeral
labels. In practice, there are a few limitations and
constrains regarding the input files, which are described in
\refsubsec{importingadigitalmusicscore}. After a score has
been imported into the system, it is divided in sequences of
a fixed number of timesteps, with each of those timesteps
sampled at fixed-duration note events. This step is
described in \refsubsec{samplingofthescore}. The sampled
scores of fixed number of timesteps are encoded into a
vector form, described in \refsubsec{encodingpitchspelling}.
This vector-form encoding becomes the input to the neural
network model.
