The \gls{cnn} blocks of the neural network are implemented
with a configurable number of layers, $N$, which is provided
as a hyperparameter. Initially, this number is set to $N=6$.
With that configuration, each \gls{cnn} block is able to
process inputs with a context of $[t$, $t + 32]$ for each
timestep $t$. That is, at each \glspl{32nd} note timestep, the
\gls{cnn} will capture information up to a \glspl{whole} note
in the future, prioritzing the patterns learned at the level
of the individual \glspl{32nd} note timestep.
