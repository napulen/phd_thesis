Each of the previous input representations, \gls{bass19},
\gls{chroma19}, and \gls{duration14} are processed by a
block of convolutional layers. These convolutional blocks
have a similar configuration, as shown in
\reffig{convolutional_blocks}.

\phdfigure[The architecture of each convolutional block. The
blocks of the \gls{bass19} and \gls{chroma19}, because they
share the same dimensionality, have identical convolutional
blocks. The size of the block for the \gls{duration14}
representation is different, and indicated on the bottom of
the figure]{convolutional_blocks}

All the layers in the convolutional block are 1D
convolutional layers. In this configuration of the layers,
the size of the kernel grows with each layer, whereas the
number of filters is reduced.
