The size of each convolutional block depends on the number
of features of each input tensor. The resulting
convolutional block of the \gls{bass19} and \gls{chroma19}
inputs contains 82 features per timestep each, whereas the
one in the \gls{duration14} input contains 77 features per
timestep. Before proceeding to the next layers of the neural
network, the tensors of all these convolutional blocks are
concatenated, resulting in a tensor of 640 timesteps with
241 ($82+82+77$) features each, as shown in
\reffig{concatenated_blocks}.
