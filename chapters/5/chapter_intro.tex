% This is the introduction to \refchap{modeldesign}, which
% goes before any of its sections.

This chapter introduces the design and implementation of the
end-to-end system for \glspl{rna} proposed in this
\thesisdiss{}. The main component of this system is a
\gls{crnn} dubbed \emph{AugmentedNet}, which is designed to
provide predictions of different tonal attributes. These
predictions are used to produce \glspl{rna} annotations.
\refsec{input} describes the input of the system.
\refsec{thebassandchromaconvolutionalblocks} describes the
convolutional layers of the neural network model.
\refsec{denseandrecurrentlayers} describes the dense and
recurrent layers of the neural network model.
\refsec{multitasklearningconfigurations} describes the
multitask learning configurations in the output layer of the
neural network model. \refsec{reconstructromannumerallabels}
describes the methods to reconstruct Roman numeral labels.
Lastly, \refsec{implementation} discusses the implementation
details of the end-to-end system.
