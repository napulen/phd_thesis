The secondary degree represents the ``denominator'' part of
a Roman numeral label. For example, in the annotation
$\rn{V}\rnseven{}/\rn{v}$, the secondary degree is $\rn{V}$.
In the multitask learning model by
\textcite{chen2018functional}, this task had \missing{number
of classes}. Secondary degrees only appear in the context of
a tonicization. Thus, the majority of the \gls{rna}
annotations will have an empty secondary degree, and a
special class to denote this empty secondary degree needs to
be included. The scarcity of secondary degrees also results
in a highly imbalanced distribution of examples, which is
problematic for training.
