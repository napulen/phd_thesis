The chord quality task depends greatly on the chord
vocabulary. The vocabulary introduced in
\textcite{chen2018functional} considered 10 classes. The one by \textcite{micchi2020not} considered a
similar number. This classification also suffers from a
great class imbalance, because the vast majority of chords
found in tonal music are major triads.
