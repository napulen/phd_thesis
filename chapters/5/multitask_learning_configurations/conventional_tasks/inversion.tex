The inversion of the chord indicates the note acting as the
bass of the chord. In the \gls{rna} system, the arrangement
of the notes above the bass is irrelevant for the
annotation. For example, the two chord realizations shown in
\reffig{inversion} are equivalent. However, modifying the
bass modifies the inversion.
