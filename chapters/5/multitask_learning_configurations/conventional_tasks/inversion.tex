The inversion of the chord indicates the note acting as the
bass of the chord. In the \gls{rna} system, the arrangement
of the notes above the bass is irrelevant for the
annotation. For example, the two chord realizations shown in
\reffig{inversion} are equivalent. However, modifying the
bass modifies the inversion.

 The inversion task generally requires 4 output classes:
 root position (no inversion), 1st inversion, 2nd inversion,
 and 3rd inversion (only for seventh chords).
