The chord root task, as it name implies, predicts the pitch
of the chord's root. In the multiclass classification
problem introduced by \textcite{chen2018functional}, there
are 12 possible chord roots (i.e., as many as pitch
classes). In the work by \textcite{micchi2020not}, this was
extended to 35 classes, as spelling was taken into account.
The system was trained to predict any root within two flats and two sharps.
