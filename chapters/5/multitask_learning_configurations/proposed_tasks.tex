The proposed multitask layer configuration consists of nine
multiclass classification problems: \gls{bass35},
\gls{tenor35}, \gls{alto35}, \gls{soprano35},
\gls{pcset121}, \gls{rn31}, \gls{localkey35},
\gls{tonicization35}, and \gls{harmonicrhythm7}. The tasks
have codenamed with their number of output classes
appended.\footnote{I opted for this naming convetion to more
easily track the evolution of the multiclass classification
problems. Some of them, such as the \gls{pcset121} or
\gls{rn31} went through various revisions, as the chord
vocabulary was adjusted during data exploration and
experiments. The names, definitions, and number of classes
presented in this \thesisdiss{} represent the latest
definition of these problems.}

Each of these tasks is subsequently used to address
different aspects of the \gls{rna} label reconstruction.
