The score \gls{csv} file contains all the information
necessary to encode the input representations of the neural
network. That is, it is the main source of information to
set up the initial layers of the neural network, the
independent inputs for the convolutional blocks. When the
model is used in inference mode (i.e., to predict labels on
unseen inputs), a score \gls{csv} file can be generated
from the \gls{musicxml} file, and that defines the input
sent to the network in order to collect the predictions on
the other end of the network.
