The annotation \gls{csv} file contains all the information
necessary to encode the output representations of the neural
network. That is, it is the main source of information to
set up the multitask learning layers at the end of the
network. Furthermore, the annotation file also contains the
necessary information to generate synthetic \gls{musicxml}
files to be used for data augmentation.
