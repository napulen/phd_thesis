The joint dataframe is a \gls{csv} file that contains the
combined information of the score and annotation dataframes.
When the preprocessed data is distributed in the repository
of the system, what is shared is the collection of joint
dataframe \gls{csv} files. In addition to all the columns of
the score and annotation dataframes, the joint dataframe is
also used as the place to verify the alignment and
correctness of annotation-and-score pairs. The output of the
common error patterns introduced in
\refsubsubsec{commonerrorpatterns} is attached to each joint
dataframe. These columns are useful to flag obvious errors
in either the annotation or score file.
