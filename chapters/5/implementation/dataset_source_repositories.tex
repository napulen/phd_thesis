Each of the datasets described in
\refsec{publiclyavailabledatasets} is provided under
different licensing conditions, formats, and mediums (e.g.,
a GitHub repository). Furthermore, the \gls{musicxml} scores
may be provided or not. In order to utilize all the data
without recurring to the redistribution of the original data
as much as possible, I opted for a workflow where GitHub
submodules were referenced in the repository hosting the
source code. When possible, these submodules link to the
original authors of the dataset.

In some instances, some modifications were necessary to
accomodate for corrections, bugs, and patches that were
needed to train the neural network. Those exist within a
folder called ``corrections''.
