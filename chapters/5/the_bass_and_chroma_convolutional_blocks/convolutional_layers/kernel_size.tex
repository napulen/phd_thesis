In a 1D convolutional layer, the kernel size
generally represents the number of timesteps in the signal
that each filter will multiply at a time. That is, a kernel
of size $3$ will multiply the signal at the current timestep
and 2 additional ones.

In this architecture, the kernel size is doubled for each
convolutional layer. The resulting filters of each layer are
concatenated with the ones from the previous layer. Thus,
the musical context of the signal is gradually increased.
