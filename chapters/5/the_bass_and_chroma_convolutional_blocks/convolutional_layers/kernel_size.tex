In a 1D convolutional layer, the kernel size, $k$, generally
represents the number of timesteps in the signal that each
filter will multiply at a time. That is, a kernel $k=3$ will
multiply the signal at the timesteps $t$, $t+1$, and $t+2$.

In the proposed architecture, $k$ is doubled for each
convolutional layer. The resulting filters of each layer are
concatenated with the ones from the previous layer. Thus,
the musical context of the signal is gradually increased.
