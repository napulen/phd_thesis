In a 1D convolutional layer, the kernel size, $k$, generally
represents the number of timesteps in the signal that each
filter will multiply at a time. That is, a kernel $k=3$ will
multiply the signal at the timesteps $t$, $t+1$, and $t+2$.

In the proposed architecture, $k$ is doubled for each
convolutional layer, as shown in \refeq{kernel_size}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:kernel_size}
    k_l = 2^{l}
\end{equation}

where $L$ is the number of convolutional layers and $l$ is
the l\superscript{th} convolutional layer. The resulting
filters of each layer are concatenated with the ones from
the previous layer. Thus, the musical context of the signal
is gradually increased.
