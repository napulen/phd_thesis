The \gls{cnn} blocks of the neural network are implemented
with a configurable number of layers in mind, which is
provided as a hyperparameter. Initially, this number was set
to six convolutional layers per block. With this number,
each \gls{cnn} block is able to process inputs with a
context of $[t, t + \musWhole{}]$ for each timestep $t$,
prioritzing the patterns learned at the level of $\:
\musThirtySecond{} \:$ notes (i.e., individual timesteps).
