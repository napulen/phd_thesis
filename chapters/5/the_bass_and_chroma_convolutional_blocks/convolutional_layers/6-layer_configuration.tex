The \gls{cnn} blocks of the neural network are implemented
with a configurable number of layers in mind, which is
provided as a hyperparameter. In practice, I found six
layers to be a good number of layers. With this number, each
\gls{cnn} block is able to process inputs with a context of
four quarter notes into the future of the current timestep,
prioritzing the patterns learned at the level of
thirty-second notes (i.e., individual timesteps).
