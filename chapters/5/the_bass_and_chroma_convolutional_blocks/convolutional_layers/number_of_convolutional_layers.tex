The \gls{cnn} blocks of the neural network are implemented
with a configurable number of layers, $N$, which is provided
as a hyperparameter. Initially, this number was set to
$N=6$. With this number, each \gls{cnn} block is able to
process inputs with a context of $[t$, $t + 32]$ for each
timestep $t$. That is, at each \musThirtySecond{} timestep,
the \gls{cnn} will capture information up to a \musWhole{}
in the future, prioritzing the patterns learned at the level
of the individual $\: \musThirtySecond{} \:$ timestep.
