The \gls{cnn} blocks of the neural network are implemented
with a configurable number of layers, $N$, which is provided
as a hyperparameter. Initially, this number was set to
$N=6$. With this number, each \gls{cnn} block is able to
process inputs with a context of $[t$, $t + \musWhole{}]$
for each timestep $t$, prioritzing the patterns learned at
the level of $\: \musThirtySecond{} \:$ notes (i.e.,
individual timesteps).
