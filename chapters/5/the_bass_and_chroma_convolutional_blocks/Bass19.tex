The first convolutional block processes the lowest-sounding
note of each timestep. Colloquially, I refer to this input
as the ``bass'' input.\footnote{Note that the term ``bass''
is problematic. A person may hear a note as the ``bass'',
and that may be or not the lowest-sounding note in the score
at a given moment. When referring to the encoding of the
input, I am always talking about the ``lowest-sounding note
in the score'', but ``bass'' is used for brevity.} The
encoding of the bass input is done using the pitch spelling
representation discussed in
\refsubsubsec{19two-hotencoding}. When this encoding
strategy is applied, it results in a one-hot encoded vector
like the one shown in \reffig{bass_encoding}.
