The encoding process of pitch in the \gls{bass19} and
\gls{chroma19} inputs destroys any information related to
note onsets, measures, and metrical structure. In order to
compensate for that, a third convolutional block is
introduced to process measure and note onsets. This
representation is denominated \gls{duration14}. The
\gls{duration14} encoding consists of two sets of features:
a multi-hot encoding of measure onsets and a multi-hot
encoding of note onsets. \reffig{duration_encoding} shows an
example of the representation.
