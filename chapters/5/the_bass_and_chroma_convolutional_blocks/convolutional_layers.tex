Each of the previous input representations, \gls{bass19},
\gls{chroma19}, and \gls{duration14} are processed by a
block of convolutional layers. These convolutional layers
feature the same configuration, shown in
\reffig{convolutional_block}.

\phdfigureproxy[The architecture of each convolutional
block]{convolutional_block}

In this configuration of the layers, the size of the kernel
grows with each layer, whereas the number of filters is
reduced.
