Each of the previous input representations, \gls{bass19},
\gls{chroma19}, and \gls{duration14} are processed by a
block of convolutional layers. These convolutional layers
feature the same configuration, shown in
\reffig{convolutional_block}.

\phdfigureproxy[The architecture of each convolutional
block]{convolutional_block}

All the layers in the convolutional block are 1D
convolutional layers. In this configuration of the layers,
the size of the kernel grows with each layer, whereas the
number of filters is reduced.
