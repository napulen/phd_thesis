After the music has been encoded as a fixed-length sequence
of pitch-spelling vectors, it is processed by the trainable
layers of the neural network. The first of these layers are
convolutional layers. The network begins by separating the
input into two convolutional blocks, one that processes the
lowest-sounding note of each timestep, and one that
processes all the notes that sound simultaneously at each
timestep. The corresponding encodings are shown in
\reffig{bass_chroma_separation}.

\phdfigureproxy[Two encodings of the same input. The first
encoding highlights the lowest-sounding note and the second
one highlights all the notes (i.e., spelled pitch classes)
sounding at a given time]{bass_chroma_separation}
