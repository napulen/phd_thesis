After the music has been encoded as a fixed-length sequence
of pitch-spelling vectors, it is processed by the trainable
layers of the neural network. The first of these layers are
convolutional layers. The network begins by separating the
input into two convolutional blocks, one that processes the
lowest-sounding note\footnote{Note that the term ``bass'' is
problematic. A person may hear a note as the ``bass'', and
that may be or not the lowest-sounding note in the score at
a given moment. When referring to the encoding of the input,
I am always talking about the ``lowest-sounding note in the
score'', even if the word ``bass'' is used.} of each
timestep, and one that processes all the notes that sound
simultaneously at each frame.
