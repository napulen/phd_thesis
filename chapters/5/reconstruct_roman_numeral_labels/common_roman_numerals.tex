In \textcite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet}, the \gls{rna}
labels were reconstructed using either the ``conventional''
method or a feature called the \emph{CommonRomanNumerals75}.

The \emph{CommonRomanNumerals75} indicated the 75-most
common classes of Roman numerals labels. These labels were
stripped from the inversion information, but not of
secondary degrees. That is, the list of 75 labels spanned
the 75-most common Roman numeral strings collapsed to their
root position form.
