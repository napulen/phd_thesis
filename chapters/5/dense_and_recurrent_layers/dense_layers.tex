After merging the convolutional blocks, the representation
has as many features per timestep as the sum of number of
features of each convolutional block.

Two dense layers are introduced to reduce the dimensionality
of each timestep before the \gls{gru} layers.

The first dense layer has 64 neurons. The second dense layer
has 32 neurons.
