Following the two dense layers, the representation of the
music has a shape of 640x32. That is, 640 \gls{32nd} note
timesteps, and 32 features in each timestep. This is the
input shape leading to the first of two \gls{gru} layers.
Both \gls{gru} layers are bidirectional, introducing 30
features from beginning to end of the sequence and 30
features from the end-to-begining of the sequence.
