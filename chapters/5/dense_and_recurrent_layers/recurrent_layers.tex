Following the two dense layers, the representation of the
music has a shape of 640x32. This is the input shape leading
to the first of two \gls{gru} layers. Both \gls{gru} layers
are bidirectional, introducing 30 features from beginning to
end of the sequence and 30 features from the end-to-begining
of the sequence.
