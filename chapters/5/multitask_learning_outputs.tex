After the recurrent layers, the last component of the
\gls{crnn} is a set of nine classification tasks, which are
arranged in a \gls{mtl} configuration. The \gls{mtl}
configuration is perhaps one of the main contributions of
this dissertation, as it defines the tonal attributes of
chords and keys that will be predicted by the network. In
previous work \parencite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet}, we
showed that having additional tasks is sometimes beneficial
to the performance of the network, especially in combination
with the synthesized training examples described in
\refsubsec{synthesisofartificialtrainingexamples}.

The proposed \gls{mtl} configuration consists of nine
multiclass classification problems: \gls{bass35},
\gls{tenor35}, \gls{alto35}, \gls{soprano35},
\gls{pcset121}, \gls{rn31}, \gls{localkey38},
\gls{tonicization38}, and \gls{harmonicrhythm7}. The tasks
are codenamed with their number of output classes
appended.\footnote{I opted for this naming convention to
more easily track the evolution of the multiclass
classification problems. Some of them, such as the
\gls{pcset121} or \gls{rn31} went through various revisions,
as the vocabularies were adjusted during data exploration
and experiments. The names, definitions, and number of
classes presented in this dissertation represent the latest
definition of these problems.} Each of the output tasks is
also tightly coupled with the musical vocabularies and
encoding methods introduced throughout the dissertation.
More specifically, the following ones:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[] $\setps_{35}$ - The encoding method for spelled
    pitches with 35 classes, described in
    \refsubsubsec{encodingnoteswithspelling}.
    \item[] $\setonset$ - The encoding method for onsets
    with 7 classes, described in
    \refsubsubsec{encodingmeasure,note,andchordonsets}.
    \item[] $\setpcset$ - The vocabulary of 121
    \gls{pcset}s, described in
    \refsec{thevocabularyofpitch-classsets}.
    \item[] $\setnum$ - The vocabulary of 31 Roman numeral
    numerators, described in
    \refsec{thevocabularyofromannumeralnumerators}.
    \item[] $\setkey$ - The vocabulary of 38 keys, described
    in
    \refsec{thevocabularyofmusicalkeys}
\end{enumerate}

Each of these tasks is subsequently used to generate the
final \gls{rna} annotations in string form, such as
$\rnwton{\rnviiosev}{ii}$.

The first four output representations, \gls{bass35},
\gls{tenor35}, \gls{alto35}, and \gls{soprano35}, are all
related to the realization of the annotated chord in a
\gls{closed-position}. Collectively, I refer to these four
classifiers as the \gls{satb35} tasks. Note that these four
tasks encode as the target class a spelled note. However,
unlike the \gls{bass19} and \gls{chroma19} input
representations, the spelled notes in the \gls{satb35}
classifiers have been encoded using the $\setps_{35}$
vocabulary, instead of $\setps_{19}$. This was done in order
to use the same loss function (sparse categorical cross
entropy) across all the \gls{mtl} tasks, which would not be
possible for the two-hot encoding required in $\setps_{19}$.
\reffig{satb_all} shows the realization of the chords in the
ground truth, which define the target class of each
\gls{satb35} classifier.
