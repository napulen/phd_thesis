One of the main contributions of this \thesisdiss{} is the
output representation of chords and tonal features. In
previous work \parencite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet}, we
showed that having additional tasks is sometimes beneficial,
especially in combination with the synthesized training
examples described in
\refsubsec{synthesisofartificialexamples}.

In this section, the ``conventional'' method of arranging
the multitask classification layers is compared against the
proposed method in this \thesisdiss{}.

The next section describes the final step for annotating
\gls{rna} labels, which involves processing the labels
predicted by the multitask classifiers.
