The time that each model took to compute its predictions on
the test set of 94 \gls{musicxml} files was measured. In
order to run the measurement, each of the files was
processed as an independent process in the operating system,
running the model with the input and output arguments for
the file in turn. For the models based on deep learning
approaches, no \gls{gpu} was used to compute the
predictions, nor they were processed in batch.
\reftab{time_performance} shows the performance of the
models.
