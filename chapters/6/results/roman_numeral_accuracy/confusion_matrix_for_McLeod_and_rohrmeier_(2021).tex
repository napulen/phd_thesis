\reffig{confusion_matrix_mcleod2021} shows the confusion
matrix for the \textcite{mcleod2021modular} model. Below
\gls{augmentednet}, the \textcite{mcleod2021modular} seemed
to have the best performance in this evaluation among all
other models. Although the performance looks better than the
previous models, it seems that the model did not benefit too
much from the standardization provided by \gls{natem}. For
example, it appears to have missed all the \gls{augsix}
chords, except for 1\% of the instances where it seemed to
recognize a $\rnGer$. Nevertheless, the performance on
\gls{neapolitan} chords was good. This model and
\gls{melisma} seem to be the only ones recognizing $\rnisev$
chords, a strange situation considering that other forms of
minor seventh chords were recognized in other models.
