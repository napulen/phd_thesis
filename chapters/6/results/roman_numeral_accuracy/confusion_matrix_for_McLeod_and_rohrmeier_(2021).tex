\reffig{confusion_matrix_mcleod2021} shows the confusion
matrix for the numerators ($\elnum$) obtained by the
predictions of the \textcite{mcleod2021modular} model,
compared against the ones in the ground truth
\gls{romantext} file. Below \gls{augmentednet}, the
\textcite{mcleod2021modular} seems to have the best
performance in this evaluation among all other models.
