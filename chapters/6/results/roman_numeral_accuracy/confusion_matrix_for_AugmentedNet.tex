\reffig{confusion_matrix_napoleslopez2022} shows the
confusion matrix for the numerators ($\elnum$) obtained by
the predictions of the \gls{augmentednet} model, compared
against the ones in the ground truth \gls{romantext} file.
In this evaluation, the performance of \gls{augmentednet}
seems to be above all other models. This is an interesting
finding, because the the results on the individual tasks
shown \reftab{comparison} seemed to show a very similar
performance between \gls{augmentednet} and
\textcite{micchi2021deep}. However, in the confusion matrix
of numerator predictions, it seems that
\textcite{mcleod2021modular} provides a better performance,
in general, and also that the gap between \gls{augmentednet}
and other models seems larger. This may be an indication of
the misleading nature of chords. Being heavily skewed
towards certain classes (e.g., $\rnI$, $\rnV$, $\rnVsev$) in
the musical practice, often the task of comparing raw
accuracy does not show the full picture of which chords are
overused by a model.
