\reffig{confusion_matrix_micchi2021} shows the confusion
matrix for the numerators ($\elnum$) obtained by the
predictions of the \textcite{micchi2021deep} model, compared
against the ones in the ground truth \gls{romantext} file.
Among all the models, the \textcite{micchi2021deep} has the
best recognition of \gls{neapolitan} chords, predicting
64.4\% of them correctly. The vertical lines on the $\rnV$
and $\rnVsev$ are less prominent than in the
\textcite{chen2021attend} and \textcite{mcleod2021modular}
models, indicating perhaps that when the model mislabel a
chord, it tends to be a distinct chord, rather than the
often overused $\rnVsev$ chords, which most models emphasize
in their predictions.
