\reffig{confusion_matrix_micchi2021} shows the confusion
matrix for the \textcite{micchi2021deep} model. Among all
the models, the \textcite{micchi2021deep} had the best
recognition of \gls{neapolitan} chords, predicting 64.4\% of
them correctly. The vertical lines on the $\rnV$ and
$\rnVsev$ are less prominent than in the
\textcite{chen2021attend} and \textcite{mcleod2021modular}
models, indicating perhaps that when the model mislabels a
chord, it tends to be a distinct chord, rather than the
often overused $\rnVsev$ chords, which most models emphasize
in their predictions.
