\reffig{confusion_matrix_chensu2021} shows the confusion
matrix for the \textcite{chen2021attend} model. The model
seemed to have a noticeably larger vocabulary than
\gls{melisma}. Although the model did not explicitly
recognize \gls{neapolitan} chords, the confusion matrix
showed that 43\% of the time it was able to provide the
correct tonal context to decode a triad acting as a
\gls{neapolitan}. This confirms the utility of the
standardization provided by \gls{natem}. The
\textcite{chen2021attend} model also seemed to have the
highest recognition of some chords, for example, $\rnivsev$,
where the accuracy is higher than in any other model.
Nevertheless, the model seemed to have a strong tendency to
mislabel many chords with $\rnVsev$.
