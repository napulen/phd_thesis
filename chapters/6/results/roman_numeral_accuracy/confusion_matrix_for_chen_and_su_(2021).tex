\reffig{confusion_matrix_chensu2021} shows the confusion
matrix for the numerators ($\elnum$) obtained by the
predictions of the \textcite{chen2021attend} model, compared
against the ones in the ground truth \gls{romantext} file.
The \textcite{chen2021attend} model seems to have a
noticeably larger vocabulary than \gls{melisma}. Compared to
other models, \gls{melisma} has a very limited chord
vocabulary. The model does not explicitly indicate what is
the chord vocabulary it supports, however, an inspection of
all the predictions the model was done to compile the
vocabulary in \reftab{chord_vocabularies}. In that table it
revealed already that \gls{melisma} does not support as many
chords as the recent mo
