\reffig{confusion_matrix_chensu2021} shows the confusion
matrix for the numerators ($\elnum$) obtained by the
predictions of the \textcite{chen2021attend} model, compared
against the ones in the ground truth \gls{romantext} file.
The \textcite{chen2021attend} model seems to have a
noticeably larger vocabulary than \gls{melisma}. Although
the model does not explicitly recognize \gls{neapolitan}
chords, the confusion matrix shows that 43\% of the time it
is able to provide the correct tonal context to decode a
triad acting as a \gls{neapolitan}. This is one of the
strengths of the standardization provided by \gls{natem}.
The \textcite{chen2021attend} also seems to have the highest
recognition of some chords, for example, $\rnivsev$, where
the accuracy is higher than any other model. Nevertheless,
the model seems to have a strong tendency to mislabel many
chords with $\rnVsev$.
