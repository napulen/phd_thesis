Arguably, one of the most important aspects of \gls{rna} is
that it provides an analytical framework for special chords,
which are usually not considered in chord labels. For
example, \gls{neapolitan} or \gls{augsix} chords.

These chords are extremely difficult to recognize, in some
instances, they occur in less than 1\% of the test set.
\reftab{rare_chords} complements the results of the
confusion matrices by comparing the accuracy of each model
on each chord class, when the classes are sorted by least
occurrence.
