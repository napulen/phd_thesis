In the third experiement, the accuracy of the models on the
numerator $\elnum$ was evaluated. One of the purposes of the
\gls{natem} algorithm was to standardize the conditions that
lead to a tonicization. As long as the key context and
\gls{pcset} are the same between the ground-truth and the
prediction, the Roman numeral numerator $\elnum$ and
tonicization $\elden$ will be the same. This might also be
useful to help the models recognize chords that do not exist
in the vocabulary of their annotations, such as
\gls{neapolitan} and \gls{augsix} chords. For each model, a
confusion matrix is shown with the target chord classes in
each row, and the predicted chord classes in each column.
