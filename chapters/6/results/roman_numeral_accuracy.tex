Additionally to the accuracy across individual tasks, the
accuracy of \gls{rna} labels is shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:micchi2021_cm}, \ref{fig:mcleod2021_cm},
and\ref{fig:napoleslopez2022_cm}.

\phdparagraph{performance on difficult chords}

Arguably, one of the most important aspects of \gls{rna} is
that it provides an analytical framework for special chords,
which are usually not considered in chord labels. For
example, \gls{neapolitan} or \gls{augsix} chords.

In this section, the performance of each model is presented
for these kinds of special chords.
