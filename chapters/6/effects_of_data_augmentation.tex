The effects of the data augmentation techniques was
evaluated on the best-performing configuration of the model.
First, the effect of transposition and synthetic files
individually. As these two methods are not mutually
exclusive and generally benefit from each other, the next
experiments measure the effects of both combined. 
% In the combined data augmentation experiments, the
% parameters of texturization for the synthetic data
% examples were modified.
