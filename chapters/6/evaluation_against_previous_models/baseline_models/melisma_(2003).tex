A comparison against the \gls{melisma} model is presented
for historical reference. \gls{melisma} was arguably the
first end-to-end \gls{arna} system that could annotate an
arbitrary musical score. After the development of the
\emph{tsroot} program in \textcite{sapp2009tsroot}, the
\gls{melisma} system was capable of processing music scores
in the \gls{humkern} representation. This model, to the best
of my knowledge, has never been evaluated against other
methods. Thus, an evaluation is presented here. The
evaluated model is the version capable of annotating
\gls{humkern} inputs, which is used in the \emph{KernScores}
library \parencite{sapp2005online}. Thus, all examples in
the test set of the comparison were converted to
\gls{humkern}. \reftab{haydnsample_melisma} shows the
representation of the input (left) and output annotations
(right) provided by \gls{melisma}.
