A comparison against the \gls{melisma} model is presented
for historical reference. The \emph{melisma music analyzer}
is arguably the first end-to-end \gls{arna} system that can
process any musical score.  This model, to the best of my
knowledge, has never been evaluated against other methods.
Thus, an evaluation is presented here. The evaluated model
is the version capable of annotating \gls{humkern} inputs,
which is used in the \emph{KernScores} library
\parencite{sapp2005online}.
