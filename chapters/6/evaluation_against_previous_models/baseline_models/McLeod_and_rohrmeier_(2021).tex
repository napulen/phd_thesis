\textcite{mcleod2021modular} proposed a \glspl{rna} model
that differs from the methodologies presented by
\textcite{chen2021attend}, \textcite{micchi2021deep}, and
the approach presented here. For example, not substituting
the \gls{mtl} configuration with a modular approach. This
model was compared against other multitask models as well as
the system proposed in this \thesisdiss{}.
