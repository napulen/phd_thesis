\textcite{mcleod2021modular} proposed an \gls{arna} model
that differs in methodology to the ones presented in
\textcite{chen2021attend}, \textcite{micchi2021deep}, and
the approach presented here. For example, it substituted the
\gls{mtl} configuration with a modular approach based on
dedicated models per task. The published model was trained
twice with different datasets: a public dataset similar to
the one in \textcite{micchi2021deep}, and a larger private
dataset of their own. The authors provided source code and
pretrained models for both versions of the model. The output
annotations of the model are provided in a tabular \gls{tsv}
format, which provides chord label and key annotations.
Another format of output based on the \gls{dcml} standard
for \gls{rna} annotations (see \refsubsec{thedcmlstandard})
was made available, but the tabular \gls{tsv} format was
used. The pretrained model used in this comparison was the
one with the best results according to the publication,
using the private dataset.
