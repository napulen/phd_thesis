\textcite{mcleod2021modular} proposed an \gls{arna} model
that differs in methodology to the ones presented by
\textcite{chen2021attend}, \textcite{micchi2021deep}, and
the approach presented here. For example, it substituted the
\gls{mtl} configuration with a modular approach based on
dedicated models per task. The published model was trained
twice with different datasets: a public dataset similar to
the one in \textcite{micchi2021deep}, and a larger private
dataset of their own. The authors provided source code and
pretrained models for both versions of the model.
