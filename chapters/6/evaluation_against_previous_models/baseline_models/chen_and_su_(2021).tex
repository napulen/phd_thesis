Over the years, Chen and Su have proposed three \gls{arna}
models \parencite{chen2018functional, chen2019harmony,
chen2021attend}. Each of these models improves over the
previous one. Thus, the latest model
\parencite{chen2021attend} was chosen for comparison. The
original publication does not provide a pre-trained model
for this neural network. Thus, one was trained from scratch.
The data and hyperparameters used for training the model was
the same as in the original publication. This model also
lacked a code implementation for running the model in
inference mode (i.e., to predict unseen examples). One
implementation was developed for this evaluation and made
publicly
available.\footnotelink{https://github.com/napulen/ChenSu21}

For completeness, the output generated by the model running the provided inference function is shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
    Composer: Haydn, Franz Joseph
    Title: String Quartet in G Minor
    Analyst: Chen and Su 2021, translated by napulen - https://github.com/napulen/ChenSu21

    m2 b3 g: V65
