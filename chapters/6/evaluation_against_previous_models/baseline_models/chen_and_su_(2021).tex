Over the years, Chen and Su have proposed three \gls{arna}
models \parencite{chen2018functional, chen2019harmony,
chen2021attend}. Each of these models improves over the
previous one. Thus, the latest model
\parencite{chen2021attend} was chosen for comparison. The
original publication does not provide a pre-trained model
for this neural network. Thus, one was trained from scratch.
The data and hyperparameters used for training the model was
the same as in the original publication. This model also
lacked a code implementation for running the model in
inference mode (i.e., to predict unseen examples). One
implementation was developed for this evaluation and made
publicly available, as well as the resulting pre-trained
model.\footnotelink{https://github.com/napulen/ChenSu21}

For completeness, the output generated by the trained model
on the excerpt of \reffig{haydnsample} is shown below. This
output results from running the trained model with the
inference source code provided.
