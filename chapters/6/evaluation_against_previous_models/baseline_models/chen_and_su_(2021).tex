Over the years, Chen and Su have proposed three \gls{arna}
models \parencite{chen2018functional, chen2019harmony,
chen2021attend}. Each of these models improves over the
previous one. Thus, the latest model
\parencite{chen2021attend} was chosen for comparison. The
original publication does not provide a pretrained model for
this neural network. Thus, one was trained from scratch. The
data and hyperparameters used for training the model was the
same as in the original publication. This model also lacked
a code implementation for running the model in inference
mode (i.e., to predict unseen examples). I provided an
implementation for this evaluation, which is made publicly
available, together with the resulting pretrained
model.\footnotelink{https://github.com/napulen/ChenSu21}
