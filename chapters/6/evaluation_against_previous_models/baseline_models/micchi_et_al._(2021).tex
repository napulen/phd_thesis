The model introduced in \textcite{micchi2021deep} is an
extension of a previous model, \textcite{micchi2020not}. The
more recent model, with \gls{nade} layers was chosen for
comparison.

The model was trained on several of the collections
introduced in \refchap{dataacquisitionandpreparation}. A
pretrained model is not provided by the authors due to
copyright reasons. In the comparison done here, the model
was trained from scratch using the full collection of scores
in the published paper \parencite{micchi2021deep}. 

% Although the dataset used to train the model in this
% dissertation is larger, I chose not to use it to train the
% \parencite{micchi2021deep}, because the annotations have
% been manually curated for that model. Thus, I preferred to
% use the curated data used for publication
