Four previous \gls{arna} models were compared against the
model proposed in this dissertation. The first model,
\gls{melisma}, is a rule-based system that does not require
training. The three remaining models are recent deep
learning approaches \parencite{chen2021attend,
micchi2021deep, mcleod2021modular}. The models often differ
in their input and output representations of the music score
and \gls{rna} annotations, respectively. In order to
illustrate the comparison proceedure, the figure on
\reffig{haydn_no3_4_comparisonsample} is used to illustrate
the inputs and outputs of each model. These are later
standardized to a comparable format, which was used to run
the experiments.
