The first model, \gls{melisma}, is a rule-based system that
does not require training. The three remaining models are
recent deep learning approaches \parencite{chen2021attend,
micchi2021deep, mcleod2021modular}. The models often differ
in their input and output representations. For example, the
symbolic music formats they accept as inputs, and the format
of their \gls{rna} annotations.
