Four previous \gls{arna} models were compared against the
model proposed in this dissertation. The first model,
\gls{melisma}, is a rule-based system that does not require
training. The three remaining models are recent deep
learning approaches \parencite{chen2021attend,
micchi2021deep, mcleod2021modular}. The models often differ
in their input and output representations. For example, the
symbolic music formats they accept as inputs, and the format
of the \gls{rna} annotations. In order to illustrate the
comparison procedure, the excerpt in \reffig{haydnsample} is
used to sample inputs and outputs from each model. The
outputs were standardized, if needed, to a comparable format
(\gls{romantext}), which was used to run the experiments.
