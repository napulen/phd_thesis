The test used for the comparison was the same one used in
the experiment of \refsec{trainingontheaggregateddataset}.
There are a total of 94 files in the test set, which were
sampled from the seven publicly available datasets (see
\refsec{publiclyavailabledatasets}). All of the input files
in the test set were provided in the \gls{musicxml} format,
and their ground-truth annotations in \gls{romantext}. The
\gls{melisma} model does not support \gls{musicxml} inputs,
in this case, all the \gls{musicxml} files were translated
into \gls{humkern}. Similarly, three models, \gls{melisma},
\textcite{chen2021attend, mcleod2021modular}, provided their
output annotations in other formats. For these models, the
original outputs were translated into \gls{romantext}. All
the comparisons were performed between the ground-truth
\gls{romantext} in the test set, and each of the annotations
provided by the models (or the translations). All the models
were evaluated with the same \gls{rna} vocabulary, which
required standardization.
