In order to perform the evaluation, all the annotations in
the \gls{romantext} files, including the ground truth, were
decomposed into their \gls{pcset} $\elpcset$, key $\elkey$,
and inversion $\elinv$ components. The components $\elpcset$
and $\elkey$ were processed by \gls{natem} to retrieve a
numerator $\elnum$ and tonicization $\elden$. This process
is illustrated for a ground-truth example of the test set in
\reftab{natem_translation}. The process performed on the
predictions of each model was identical, using their
\gls{romantext} files.

Three evaluation experiments were performed with this
workflow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, an initial experiment evaluating the
    inference time of each of the models, measuring the time
    it took to process each \gls{musicxml} file set
    \gls{musicxml} (or \gls{humkern}) files.
    \item Second, the models were evaluated in the accuracy
    of their $\elpcset$, $\elkey$ and $\elinv$ components
    \item Third, using the $\elnum$ retrieved from
    \gls{natem}, the accuracy of the $\elnum$ numerators was
    evaluated, compared to the $\elnum$ obtained for the
    ground truth
\end{enumerate}

dataset. The original annotations (leftmost column) are
parsed from a \gls{romantext} file, and decomposed into a
\gls{pcset} $\elpcset$, key $\elkey$, and inversion $\elinv$
components (middle columns). Then, a numerator $\elnum$ and
