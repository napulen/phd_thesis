The vocabulary of each model is different, as shown in
\reftab{chord_vocabularies}. In addition to the different
qualities of chords supported by each model, the \gls{rna}
syntax is also often distinct (see
\refsec{standardizationofromannumeralannotations}). 

\phdtable[The chord vocabularies of the compared
models]{chord_vocabularies}

Some of the models provide two layers of key analysis, such
as \gls{augmentednet}, whereas others provide one key
prediction, such as the model in
\textcite{mcleod2021modular}. This makes it difficult to
have a fair comparison across all of them. Furthermore, the
models might be in fact able to recognize chords that are
not explicitly considered in their vocabulary. For example,
neither the \gls{melisma} nor the
\textcite{mcleod2021modular} models explicitly recognize
\gls{augsix} chords. However, a label of $\rnVsev$ may be
interpreted as an \gls{augsix} chord in a certain key
context, even if the predictions of the model do not
indicate it as such. This is true for other types of chords
too, such as \gls{neapolitan} chords. All of these issues
combined were a motivation to propose the \gls{natem}
algorithm (see
\refsec{thenumeratorandtonicizationestimationmethod}), which
makes it possible to use a common representation for all the
annotations of the five models, regardless of the source
format. The inputs to the \gls{natem} algorithm are a
\gls{pcset} $\elpcset \in \setpcset$ (see
\refsec{thevocabularyofpitch-classsets}) and a key $\elkey
\in \setkey$ (see \refsec{thevocabularyofmusicalkeys}).
Given those inputs, the algorithm provides one of the 31
numerators $\elnum \in \setnum$ (see
\refsec{thevocabularyofromannumeralnumerators}), and a
tonicization $\elden \in \setden$ if necessary.
