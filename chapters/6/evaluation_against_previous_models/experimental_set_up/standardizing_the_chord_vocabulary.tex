The vocabulary of each model is different, as shown in
\reftab{chord_vocabularies}. Regarding the quality

\phdtable[The chord vocabularies of the compared
models]{chord_vocabularies}


For example, the \gls{melisma} and
\textcite{mcleod2021modular} models do not explicitly
recognize \gls{augsix} chords. However, a label of $\rnVsev$
in the right key context could be interpreted as an
\gls{augsix} chord and recognized implicitly. This was a
