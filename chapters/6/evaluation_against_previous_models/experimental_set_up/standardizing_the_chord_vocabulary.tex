The vocabulary of each model is different, as shown in
\reftab{chord_vocabularies}. In addition to the different
qualities of chords supported by each model, the notation is
also often distinct. This makes it difficult for a fair
comparison across all of them. Furthermore, the models might
be in fact able to recognize chords that are not explicitly
mentioned. For example, neither the \gls{melisma} nor the
\textcite{mcleod2021modular} models explicitly recognize
\gls{augsix} chords. However, a label of $\rnVsev$ in the
correct key context may be interpreted as an \gls{augsix}
chord and recognized regardless of how it is annotated. This
is true for other types of chords too, such as
\gls{neapolitan}. This was a motivation to propose the
\algorithmrn{} algorithm for the retrieval of \gls{rna}
numerators from \gls{pcset} and keys.
