This chapter introduces the experiments that evaluate the
end-to-end \glspl{rna} system proposed here.
\refsec{ablationstudies} introduces a series of ablation
studies to assess the contributions of the different
components of the neural network, as well as the data
augmentation techniques.
\refsec{bestperformingmodelconfiguration} summarizes the
characteristics of the best performing model, according to
the ablation studies.
\refsec{beststrategyforfinalromannumeralreconstruction}
discusses the strategies to postprocess the predictions of
the neural network to reconstruct the final \gls{rna} labels
output by the system.
\refsec{evaluationagainstpreviousmodels} describes the
experimental set up to compare the resulting model and
postprocessing strategies against previous approaches.
\refsec{results} presents the results of the evaluation.
\refsec{discussion} discusses the overall observations of
the experiments.
