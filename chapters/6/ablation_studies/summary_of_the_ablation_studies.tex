\phdtablefit[Performance obtained in the ablation studies,
compared to the baseline configuration of the network. The
``Baseline'' row shows the average accuracy obtained in each
task across the 5-fold cross validation. Each row of the
ablation studies shows the difference in accuracy between
the value obtained in the experiment and the baseline. The
biggest drop in performance for each task column is

\reftab{ablation} shows a summary of the performance of the
different configurations in the ablation experiments. Some
of these results confirm the expected results. For example,
removing the \gls{duration14} input representation affects
the \gls{harmonicrhythm7} more than any other change in the
model configuration. This might indicate that measure onsets
are important for a better chord segmentation. Removing the
\gls{chroma19} input representation has noticeable effects
on the prediction of chords (e.g., \gls{pcset121},
\gls{rn31}). Unexpectedly, it also affects the
\gls{soprano35} task more than any other \gls{satb35} task.
On the contrary, removing the \gls{bass19} input
representation affects the performance of the \gls{tenor35}
and \gls{alto35} tasks, in addition to the \gls{bass35},
which was the expected outcome.

Overall, the biggest drop in performance happens when the
recurrent layers of the network are removed. The recurrent
layers have a notable effect on the ``key'' tasks:
\gls{localkey38} and \gls{tonicization38}. This supports the
hypothesis that a longer musical context is needed to
estimate musical keys, in comparison to estimating chords.
It is interesting that among the chord tasks, however,
\gls{rn31} is the one affected the most by the removal of
the recurrent layers. This might be because Roman numeral
numerators are relative to the key, and thus sensitive to
the key context.

In the row of the baseline model, the standard deviation
($\sigma$) across the 5-fold cross validation is provided.
All the differences in performance highlighted in
\reftab{ablation} are at least 2 standard deviations below
the performance of the baseline. Most modifications in the
ablation studies have a negative effect compared to the
baseline model, except for the dense linear layer. This was
an unexpected result, because that did not seem to be the
case in preliminary experiments. It could be that the
nonlinear activation in the dense layers of the baseline
model work better when data augmentation is introduced.
