The measure and note onset information provided by the
\gls{duration14} representation provides the network with
structural information about the score. Namely, the location
of beginnings of notes and beginnings of measures. An
ablation study is proposed where this input representation
is omitted. The hypothesis is that this will be detrimental
to the performance of the neural network, particularly,
affecting the chord segmentation characterized by the
\gls{harmonicrhythm7} task. The modifications proposed are
shown in \reffig{ablation4}.
