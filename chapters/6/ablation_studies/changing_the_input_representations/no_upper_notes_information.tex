An analog of the previous experiment would be to guess the
chord knowing only the lowest-sounding note at a given time,
but none of the other notes in the staff. The \gls{chroma19}
input representation provides all the note information at a
given time, without it, only the lowest-sounding one is
known (which is provided by the \gls{bass19}
representation). An ablation study is also proposed to
demonstrate the effects of removing the \gls{chroma19} input
representation. The hypothesis is that it should be
detrimental to tasks related to chords: \gls{pcset121},
\gls{rn31}, as well as the three upper \gls{satb35} tasks:
\gls{soprano35}, \gls{alto35}, and \gls{tenor35}.
\reffig{ablation3} summarizes the changes to the input
representation.

study, where the \gls{chroma19} representation is removed.

configuration]{ablation3}
