An analog of the previous experiment would be to guess the
chord knowing only the lowest-sounding note at a given time,
but none of the other notes in the staff. An ablation study
is also proposed to demonstrate the effects of this. The
hypothesis is that it should be detrimental to the tasks
related to the chord configuration: \gls{pcset121},
\gls{rn31}, as well as the three upper \gls{satb35} tasks:
\gls{soprano35}, \gls{alto35}, and \gls{tenor35}.
