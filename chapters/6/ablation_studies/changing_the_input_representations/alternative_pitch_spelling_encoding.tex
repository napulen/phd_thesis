In \refsubsubsec{19two-hotencoding}, a new method to encode
pitch spelling was proposed using a 19-dimensional vector.
This method was used in the baseline configuration of the
model presented in \refchap{modeldesign}. The pitch-spelling
method is a replacement of another 35-dimensional vector
encoding used by a previous model
\parencite{micchi2021deep}. The new encoding method leads to
a reduction of trainable parameters, encoding of pitches
beyond two sharps ($\musDoubleSharp$) and two flats
($\musDoubleFlat$), and it is generally more interpretable
than the alternative. The current ablation study proposes to
use the more common encoding based on 35 classes of pitch
spellings within the range
[C$\musDoubleFlat$, B$\musDoubleSharp$]. The hypothesis of the
experiment is that no significant performance gains will be
obtained with the 35-dimensional representation, and that
the 19-dimensional one is an adequate replacement.
