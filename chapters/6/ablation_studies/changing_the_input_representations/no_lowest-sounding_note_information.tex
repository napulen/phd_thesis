Intuitively, there is a clear correlation between the lowest
sounding note in the musical staff and the ``bass'' note of
the chord. If a human analyst was required to indicate the
inversion of a chord knowing which notes are sounding in the
staff, but not knowing which of them is sounding the lowest,
it would make the task very difficult, if not impossible.
The lowest-sounding note is provided to the network in the
\gls{bass19} input representation. This ablation study
proposes removing that representation, which should be
detrimental to the \gls{bass35} classification task (i.e.,
predicting the bass of the chord). The \gls{bass35} is the
task used to retrieve the inversion of the chord. The
modifications proposed are shown in \reffig{ablation2}.
