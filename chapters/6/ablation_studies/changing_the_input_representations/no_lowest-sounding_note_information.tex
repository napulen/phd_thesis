Intuitively, there is a clear correlation between the lowest
sounding note in the musical staff and the ``bass'' note of
the chord. If a human analyst was required to indicate the
inversion of a chord knowing which notes are sounding in the
staff, but not knowing which of them is sounding the lowest,
it would make the task very difficult, if not impossible.
The lowest-sounding note is provided to the network in the
\gls{bass19} input representation. This ablation study
proposes removing that representation, which should be
detrimental to the \gls{bass35} classification task (i.e.,
predicting the bass of the chord), which is the task used to
retrieve the inversion of the chord. The modifications
proposed are shown in \reffig{ablation2}.
