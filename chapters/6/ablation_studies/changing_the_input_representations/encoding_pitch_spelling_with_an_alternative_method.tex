In \refsubsubsec{19two-hotencoding}, a new method to encode
pitch spelling was proposed using a 19-dimensional vector.
This method was used in the baseline model of the ablation
studies to encode the pitch spelling of the \gls{bass19} and
\gls{chroma19} input representations. The pitch-spelling
method is a replacement of a 35-dimensional vector encoding
used by a previous model \parencite{micchi2021deep}. The new
encoding method, among other things, reduces the number of
trainable parameters. The current ablation study proposes to
use the 35-dimensional representation in
\textcite{micchi2021deep} instead of the method chosen for
the baseline. The hypothesis of the experiment is that no
significant performance gains will be obtained if the
35-dimensional representation is used, and that the
19-dimensional one is an adequate replacement. The
modifications proposed are shown in \reffig{ablation1}.
