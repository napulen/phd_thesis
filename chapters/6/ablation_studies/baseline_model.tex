All the ablation studies are compared against a baseline
model. The baseline model consists of the \gls{crnn}
described in \refchap{modeldesign}, which comprises three
input representations (\gls{bass19}, \gls{chroma19}, and
\gls{duration14}) described in \refsubsec{encodingthescore},
a block of $n=6$ convolutional layers described in
\refsec{theconvolutionalblocks}, two dense layers, and two
\gls{rnn} layers with \gls{gru} units (see
\refsec{denseandrecurrentlayers}). The baseline model has 9
classification outputs in the \gls{mtl} layout described in
\refsec{multitasklearningoutputs}, however, these remain
constant in the ablation studies.
