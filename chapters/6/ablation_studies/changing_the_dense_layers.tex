The purpose of the dense layers between the \gls{cnn} and
\gls{rnn} parts of the network is to reduce the
dimensionality of the representation after the convolutional
layers. \refsubsubsec{changingthedenselayers} explores the
effects of replacing the two dense layers with nonlinear
activations with one linear layer (i.e., dimensionality
reduction with a linear behavior).
