The input information provided to the neural network is
arguably one of the most important decisions that needs to
be made. In the proposed system, the input consists of three
representations: \gls{bass19}, \gls{chroma19}, and
\gls{duration14}. Furthermore, the pitch information
considers the spelling of the notes, but discards the
octave,\footnote{This particular aspect, ignoring the octave
of a pitch, was not assessed in the ablation studies below.
However, relevant experiments were presented by
\textcite{micchi2020not}. In preliminary experiments, I
found my results to be consistent with those of
\textcite{micchi2020not}. That is, a representation where
pitch height is removed has better results than one where
octave is explicitly encoded.} and it is divided between the
bottom note of the timestep (\gls{bass19}) and the remaining
notes of the timestep (\gls{chroma19}). The experiments in
\refsubsubsec{pitchspellingencodingmethod} consider the
effects of modifying the pitch spelling encoding method. The
ones in \refsubsubsec{onsetinformation} the effects of
removing pitch and onset information.
