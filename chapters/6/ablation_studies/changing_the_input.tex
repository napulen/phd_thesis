The information provided to the neural network is arguably
one of the most important decisions that needs to be made.
In the proposed system, the input consists of pitch
information and onset information. Furthermore, the pitch
information considers the spelling of the notes, but not the
octave, and it is divided between the bottom note of the
chord and all the notes of the chord. The following
experiments consider modifying the baseline model by
changing the pitch spelling encoding method
\refsubsubsec{pitchspellingencodingmethod} and removing
pitch and onset information \refsubsubsec{onsetinformation}.
