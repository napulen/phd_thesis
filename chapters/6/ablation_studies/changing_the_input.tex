The input information provided to the neural network is
arguably one of the most important decisions that needs to
be made. In the proposed system, the input consists of three
representations: \gls{bass19}, \gls{chroma19}, and
\gls{duration14}. Furthermore, the pitch information
considers the spelling of the notes, but discards the
octave,\footnote{This particular aspect, ignoring the octave
of a pitch, was not assessed in the ablation studies below.
However, relevant experiments were presented by
\textcite{micchi2020not}. In preliminary experiments, the
results obtained for the proposed model were consistent with
the previous study. That is, a representation without pitch
height leads to a higher accuracy than a representation with
pitch height.} and it is divided between the bottom note of
the timestep (\gls{bass19}) and the remaining notes of the
timestep (\gls{chroma19}). The experiments in
\refsubsubsec{pitchspellingencodingmethod} consider the
effects of modifying the pitch spelling encoding method. The
ones in \refsubsubsec{onsetinformation} consider the effects
of removing pitch and onset information.
