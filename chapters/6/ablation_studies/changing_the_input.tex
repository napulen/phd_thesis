The input information provided to the neural network is
arguably one of the most important decisions that needs to
be made. In the proposed system, the input consists of three
representations: \gls{bass19}, \gls{chroma19}, and
\gls{duration14}. Furthermore, the pitch information
considers the spelling of the notes, but discards the
octave, and it is divided between the bottom note of the
timestep (\gls{bass19}) and the remaining notes of the
timestep (\gls{chroma19}). The following experiments
consider modifying the baseline model by changing the pitch
spelling encoding method described in
\refsubsubsec{pitchspellingencodingmethod}) and removing
pitch and onset information described in
\refsubsubsec{onsetinformation}).
