The number of convolutional blocks is defined by the number
of input representations send to the neural network. In the
baseline model, there are three convolutional blocks, one
for each of the \gls{bass19}, \gls{chroma19}, and
\gls{duration14} representations. Here, two experiments are
proposed. The first experiment explores the effects of
concatenating all the input tensors and processing the
resulting tensor with a single convolutional block. The
second experiment explores a more extreme case of
independent inputs, where the \gls{bass19} and
\gls{chroma19} are divided into pitch class and note letter
representations, for a total of six input representations,
which are processed by an independent convolutional block.
