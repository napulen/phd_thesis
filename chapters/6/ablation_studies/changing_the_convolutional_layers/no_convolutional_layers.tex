The number of layers in each convolutional block determine
how much context is provided to the \gls{cnn}. It also
affects the number of trainable parameters on the \gls{cnn}
part of the network. This experiment explores removing all
the convolutional layers. The modifications proposed are shown in
\reffig{ablation7}.
