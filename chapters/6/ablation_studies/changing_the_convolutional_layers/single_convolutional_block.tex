The number of convolutional blocks is defined by the number
of input representations sent to the neural network. In the
baseline model, there are three convolutional blocks, one
for each of the \gls{bass19}, \gls{chroma19}, and
\gls{duration14} input representations. This experiment
explores the effects of concatenating all the input tensors
and processing the resulting tensor with a single
convolutional block, as shown in \reffig{ablation5}.
