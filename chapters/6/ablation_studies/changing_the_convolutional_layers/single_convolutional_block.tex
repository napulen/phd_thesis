The number of convolutional blocks is defined by the number
of input representations sent to the neural network. In the
baseline model, there are three convolutional blocks, one
for each of the \gls{bass19}, \gls{chroma19}, and
\gls{duration14} representations. This experiment explores
the effects of concatenating all the input tensors and
processing the resulting tensor with a single convolutional
block.
