The number of convolutional blocks is defined by the number
of input representations sent to the neural network. In the
baseline model, there are three convolutional blocks, one
for each of the \gls{bass19}, \gls{chroma19}, and
\gls{duration14} input representations. An experiment is
proposed to explore the effects of concatenating (i.e.,
stacking) all the inputs into a single vector per timestep.
The resulting sequence is processed by a single
convolutional block, as shown in \reffig{ablation5}. This
experiment should indicate whether the performance of the
network is affected by processing the inputs by their own
convolutional block or not.
