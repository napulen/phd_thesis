Three experiments are proposed here. First, removing all the
convolutional layers. Second, providing less context with each convolutional block (5 layers). Third, providing more context with each convolutional block (7 layers).

\phdparagraph{no convolutional layers}
\phdparagraph{five convolutional layers}
\phdparagraph{seven convolutional layers}
