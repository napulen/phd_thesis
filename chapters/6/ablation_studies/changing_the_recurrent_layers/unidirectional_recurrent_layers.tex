In the baseline model, a bidirectional recurrent layer is
used. Using this configuration doubles the number of
parameters that each recurrent layer needs to learn. An
experiment is proposed to verify the effects of processing
the musical only from beginning to end, and not from end to
beginning. The modifications proposed are shown in
\reffig{ablation10}.
