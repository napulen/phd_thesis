An analog of the previous experiment would be to guess the
chord knowing only the lowest sounding note at a given time,
but not all the other sounding notes in the staff. An
ablation study is also proposed to demonstrate the effects
of this. The hypothesis is that it should be detrimental to
the tasks related to the chord configuration,
\gls{pcset121}, \gls{rn31}, and the three upper ``SATB''
tasks \gls{soprano35}, \gls{alto35}, and \gls{tenor35}.
