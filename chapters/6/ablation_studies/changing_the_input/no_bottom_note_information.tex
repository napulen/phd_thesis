Intuitively, there is a clear correlation between the lowest
sounding note in the musical staff and the ``bass'' note of
the chord. If a human analyst was required to indicate the
inversion of a chord knowing which notes are sounding in the
staff, but not knowing which of them is sounding the lowest,
it would make the task very difficult, if not impossible.
This ablation study proposes that experiment, a missing
\gls{bass19} input representation, which should clearly be
detrimental to the \gls{bass35} task of the network, which
is the task used to retrieve the inversion of the chord.
