In \refsubsubsec{19two-hotencoding}, an alternative method
to encode pitch spelling was proposed using a 19-dimensional
vector. This method leads to a reduction of parameters,
encoding of pitches beyond two sharps ($\musDoubleSharp$)
and two flats ($\musDoubleFlat$), and it is generally more
interpretable. The current ablation study proposes to use
the more common encoding based on 35 classes of pitch
spellings within the range
C$\musDoubleFlat$--B$\musDoubleSharp$. The hypothesis of the
experiment is that no significant performance gains will be
obtained with the 35-dimensional representation, and that
the 19-dimensional one is an adequate replacement.
