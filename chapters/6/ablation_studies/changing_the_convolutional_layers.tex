In the baseline model, the convolutional blocks process each
of the inputs independently, which are later concatenated.
The architecture of the convolutional blocks is identical,
using the same number of layers and the same strategy to
adjust the number of filters and kernel size in each layer.
The experiments in this section explore modifications to
those components of the model design.
\refsubsubsec{numberofconvolutionalblocks} explores the
performance of the neural network with a single
convolutional block or an extreme case of six convolutional
blocks. \refsubsubsec{filters-kernelratio} explores the
performance of the neural network with a constant number of
filters in each layer, testing the hypothesis that capturing
short-term patterns is preferred.
\refsubsubsec{numberofconvolutionallayers} explores changes
to the number of convolutional layers in each block.
