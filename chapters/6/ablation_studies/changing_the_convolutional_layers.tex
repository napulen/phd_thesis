In the baseline model, the convolutional blocks process the
three inputs independently, which are later concatenated.
The architecture of the convolutional blocks is identical,
using the same number of layers and the same strategy to
adjust the number of filters and kernel size in each layer.
The experiments in this section explore modifications to
those components of the model design.
\refsubsubsec{singleconvolutionalblock} explores the
performance of the neural network with a single
convolutional block. \refsubsubsec{constantnumberoffilters}
explores the performance of the neural network with a
constant number of filters in each layer, testing the
hypothesis that capturing short-term patterns is preferred.
The last experiment in \refsubsubsec{noconvolutionallayers}
explore the effects of removing all convolutional layers
entirely.
