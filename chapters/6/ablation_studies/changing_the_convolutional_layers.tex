In the baseline model, the convolutional blocks process the
three inputs independently, which are later concatenated.
The convolutional blocks for all three inputs are similar:
they have the same number of layers ($n=6$, see
\refsubsubsec{numberofconvolutionalfilters}) and use the
same strategy to adjust the kernel size (see
\refsubsubsec{kernelsize}) and number of filters (see
\refsubsubsec{numberoffilters}) of each layer. The
experiments in this section explore modifications to those
components of the model design.
\refsubsubsec{singleconvolutionalblock} explores the
performance of the neural network with a single
convolutional block. \refsubsubsec{constantnumberoffilters}
explores the performance of the neural network with a
constant number of filters in each layer, testing the
hypothesis that capturing short-term patterns is preferred.
The last experiment in \refsubsubsec{noconvolutionallayers}
explore the effects of removing all convolutional layers
entirely.
