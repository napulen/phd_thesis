The recurrent layers of the network are arguably the most
important trainable component of the neural network. In the
baseline model, this section consists of two bidirectional
recurrent layers. \refsubsubsec{numberofrecurrentlayers}
explores the removal of both recurrent layers and
\refsubsubsec{layertype} explores the removal of the
bidirectional configuration.
