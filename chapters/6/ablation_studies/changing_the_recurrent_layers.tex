The recurrent layers of the network are arguably the most
important trainable component of the neural network. In the
baseline model, this section consists of two bidirectional
recurrent layers. \refsubsubsec{norecurrentlayers} explores
the removal of both recurrent layers and
\refsubsubsec{unidirectionalrecurrentlayers} explores the
removal of the bidirectional configuration.
