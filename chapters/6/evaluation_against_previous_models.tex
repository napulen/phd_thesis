Several \gls{arna} models have been proposed in the past.
This section introduces the experimental set up to compare
the proposed model against four previous ones:
\gls{melisma}, \textcite{chen2021attend, micchi2021deep,
mcleod2021modular}. Whenever a pretrained model (or program)
was provided, it has been used in the experiments. If no
pretrained model was available, one was trained from scratch
using the dataset and hyperparameters of the original
publication. Each of the models required a unique workflow
to integrate them into the common evaluation. These methods
are described below. 
% Regarding the last point, an alternative option would have
% been to re-train all of the models with the aggregated
% dataset described here. However, the musical vocabularies
% of the models, music representations, and data-curation
% processes are often distinct. Migrating the prepared
% dataset in this dissertation to each of the four models'
% workflows proved extremely difficult. Thus, I opted for
% comparing against the version of the model published in
% the literature. Yet, all the models were evaluated on the
% same test set.
