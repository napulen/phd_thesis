Several \gls{arna} models have been proposed over the years.
This section introduces the experimental set up to to
compare the proposed model against four previously proposed
\gls{arna} models. Whenever a pre-trained model (or program)
has been provided, it has been used in the experiments. If
no pre-trained model was available, one was trained from
scratch using the dataset and hyperparameters of the
original publication. Regarding the last point, an
alternative option would have been to re-train all of the
models with the aggregated dataset described here. However,
the musical vocabularies of the models, music
representations, and data-curation process are often
distinct. Migrating the curated dataset to each of the four
models' workflows proved extremely time consuming. Thus, I
opted for comparing against the version of the model
published in the literature. Yet, all the models were
evaluated on the same test set.
