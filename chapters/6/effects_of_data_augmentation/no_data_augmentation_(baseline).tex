In the first experiment, the baseline model (see
\refsubsec{baselinemodel}) was trained with the original
training data of each publicly available dataset: \gls{abc},
\gls{bps}, \gls{haydnsun}, \gls{kmt}, \gls{mps},
\gls{tavern}, and \gls{wir}. The full training set of each
dataset was used in the experiment, with the reserved test
portion used to run the evaluation.
\reftab{augmentation_baseline} shows the number of training
examples, test examples, and the training time of the
experiment.
