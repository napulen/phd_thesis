In the first experiment, the baseline model (see
\refsubsec{baselinemodel}) was trained on the original data
of each of the seven datasets: \gls{abc}, \gls{bps},
\gls{haydnsun}, \gls{kmt}, \gls{mps}, \gls{tavern}, and
\gls{wir}. The full training set of each dataset was used in
the experiment, with the reserved test portion used to run
the evaluation.
