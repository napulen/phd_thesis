The techniques of transposition and synthesis of new
training examples are not mutually exclusive. In the last
experiment, the impact of both techniques in conjunction is
evaluated.

Because the individual datasets used in this \thesisdiss{}
vary significantly from each other, the experiments with
data augmentation techniques were performed over each
individual dataset. The results in Figures
\ref{fig:da_val_loss} and \ref{fig:da_val_accuracy} show the
performance of the model with and without data augmentation
for 200 epochs on each dataset. \reftab{augmentation}
summarizes the performance obtained after selecting the best
weights for each experiment.
