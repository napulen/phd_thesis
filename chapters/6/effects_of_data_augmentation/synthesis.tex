In the second experiment, the data-augmentation technique
proposed in \textcite{napoleslopez2021augmentednet} is
applied to the seven training sets. When the synthesis is
used in an experiment, it is used to double the size of the
training set: one real example, and one synthesized from its
\gls{rna} annotations. Thus, the augmented training set is
twice the size of the original one in the previous
experiment. \reftab{augmentation_synthesis} shows the
parameters and training time of the experiment.
