In a large number of \gls{mir} works, transposition has been
used as a data augmentation technique to overcome the
scarcity of data. When pitch spelling is taken into account,
it requires the additional consideration that transpositions
into two enharmonic keys are distinct from each other. This
was explored by \textcite{micchi2020not} and also here. The
first experiment here measures the effect of transposition
in the performance of the model.
