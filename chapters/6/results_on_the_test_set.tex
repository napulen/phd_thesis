\refsec{ablationstudies} introduced a baseline \gls{crnn}
model and a series of experiments to explore the its
underlying components. This baseline model was subsequently
used in \refsec{effectsofdataaugmentation} to explore the
effects of data-augmentation techniques when training the
model on seven publicly available datasets. In the
experiments of \refsec{effectsofdataaugmentation}, the model
was trained on each dataset individually. However, the best
performance is achieved when more data is used to train the
model.

This section reports the results of training the model with
the aggregated dataset, consisting of all the training data
across the seven publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
the model was evaluated on the test portion of each
individual dataset. The results are reported in
\reftab{final_results_dataset}. In this experiment, both
data-augmentation techniques, \emph{transposition} and
\emph{synthesis}, were used in combination.
