A \glspl{rna} system is more than a neural network
architecture. It should be seen as an end-to-end system that
consists both machine learning components and rule-based
systems. When I started this project, I started it under the
assumption that the goal was to create a ``machine learning
system'' that would solve the problem. However, from the
beginning, parsing different datasets in different
annotation formats soon made me realize that domain
knowledge was necessary to clean the datasets, standardize
their musical assumptions, define the chord vocabulary, and
so on. This is true for the exit of the system as well. The
way classification outputs are defined, the number of key
layers in the musical analysis, the spelling of certain
Roman numerals (e.g., that infamous $\rn{I}\rnsixfour$ vs
$\rn{V}\rnsixfour$, for which I have a standing). A
\glspl{rna} system is a unified model that spans both
technical and musical decisions. It should arguably be
evaluated as such.
