According to the previous experiments, the best
configuration of the model consists of \missing{parameters
of the best-performing configuration}.

The pitch and onset representations from the input
contribute differently to the tonal problems at hand.

In the convolutional layers, \missing{important points about
convolution}.

The dense layers, beyond reducing the dimensionality of each
timestep in the tensor, \missing{important points about
dense layers}.

Finally, the lack of recurrent layers results in
\missing{important points about rnn}.
