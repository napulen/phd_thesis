It is difficult to understand what kind of representations a
deep learning model learns during training. Ablation studies
are an useful way to inspect the contribution of its
different components. This section introduces a series of
ablation studies, where the performance of the model is
evaluated across all the datasets after modifying or
removing some of its components. The ablation studies are
divided by component of the neural network: input
representations, convolutional layers, dense layers, and
recurrent layers.

The ablation studies were run over the aggregated dataset,
without transposition nor synthetic files for data
augmentation, whose effects was evaluated separately (see \refsec{effectsofdataaugmentaiton}).
