This section introduces the results of the evaluation
against previous models. Unfortunately, the models are often
defined in different ways and solving similar but not
identical problems, making a one-to-one comparison
difficult. For example, the model by
\textcite{mcleod2021modular} considers one layer of key
analysis, whereas this model and others consider two layers
(i.e., modulations and tonicizations). However, when
possible, a comparison of individual tasks is performed.
Using a reduced vocabulary of Roman numerals, it is possible
to ``collapse'' several classes of chords into a single
string representation. Using this approach, the models can
be compared for their Roman numeral annotations directly,
instead of the classification problems. This approach is
particularly useful when assessing the performance of the
models on difficult chords, that appear only sporadically in
the dataset. The performance on such difficult chords is
presented in \refsubsec{performanceondifficultchords}.
