\subsection{A brief history of Roman numeral analysis}


Roman numeral analysis is a common methodology presented in music theory textbooks focused on the common practice period.
The name derives from the use of Roman numerals to denote scale degrees, which, in turn, denote diatonic chords in a certain key context.
It is difficult to place a specific time when this notational system emerged.
It would appear to be more accurate to say that this notation did not ``appear'' but evolved, slowly, from the sporadic use of Roman numerals to denote scale degrees to the complex syntax of applied chords and chord inversions used today.

In this chapter, I summarize a brief timeline of this evolution process.
There is existing literature describing the process to a certain extent.
For example, in the chapters on tonality of the Cambridge History of Western Music Theory~\parencite{christensen_2002}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item According to Hyer, there are two branches of tonal music theory around the early nineteenth century: scale-degree theories and functional theories
    \item Scale-degree theories are best characterized by the work of Weber and Schenker
    \item Functional theories include those of Rameau and Riemann
    \item Roman numerals, nowadays unify concepts from these two theories, acting as a metalanguage
    \item Combination of theories is common, for example, Fuxian theory taught by first analyzing the harmonic context of the C.F., and other examples
    \item Arguable, Rameau's work influenced every other subsequent harmonic theory
    \item Rameau introduced the concepts of tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords
    \item However, he never used the term ``function'', which was established by Riemann
    \item Vogler introduced Roman numerals for the first time
    \item First, in 17XX, where he used them to denote the ``VII'' degree
    \item Then, 1802, he used them for every scale degree
    \item Weber firmly established Roman numerals
    \item Nowadays, Roman numerals have borrowed ideas from both branches of music theories
\end{itemize}



It is generally agreed that the first to introduce Roman numerals to indicate degrees was Vogler.
Furthermore, the first to unambiguously introduce Roman numerals to denote chords was Weber~\parencite{weber_theory_2018}.
Beyond these assertions, little is known about how the syntax evolved into the conventions followed nowadays.
% In order to complement this information with evidence of the literature of the time, I include a table of music textbooks and their adoption of Roman numeral syntax.
Although there is not an official standardization of Roman numeral analysis, modern annotations often feature the following characteristics:

% $$
% k:r^{q}^{x}_{y}/r
% $$
% where $k$ represents a key, $r$ a scale degree, $q$ a qualitative alteration (e.g., diminished or augmented), $x$ is the numerator of an inversion, $y$ another number for denoting certain inversions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A numeric inversion with one or two digits (e.g., $^6_5$, $^4_3$, $^2$, $^6_4$, $^6$)
    \item A slash followed by a scale degree to denote an applied chord, secondary dominant, or tonicization (e.g., V/V)
    \item A distinction between major and minor triads (e.g., I (major) i (minor))
\end{enumerate}

In order to better visualize this organic evolution of the syntax, I have compiled my observations across several harmony books starting in the late nineteenth century.
In each textbook, I have indicated whether the chords are annotated using Roman numerals, and whether other modern traits are observed (e.g., inversions depicted with arabic numerals next to the Roman numerals, or secondary dominants presented as V/V).
