The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is described by \textcite{hankinson2011music} as a ``community-driven effort to define guidelines for encoding musical documents in a machine-readable structure''. As part of those guidelines, a family of music formats have been developed over the years. In its flavor for common Western music notation, the MEI format describes musical content using an XML-based syntax with an emphasis on musical semantics.

\phdparagraph{origin of mei}

The MEI community (and format) was first presented by \textcite{roland2002music}, where it tried to replicate the efforts of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) to musical data. Starting in 2013, a yearly conference organized by the MEI community has perpetuated the involvement of different academics in the development of guidelines for the format \cite{crawford2016review}.
