% This is \refsubsubsec{mei}, which introduces the mei.

The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is described by
\textcite{hankinson2011music} as a ``community-driven effort
to define guidelines for encoding musical documents in a
machine-readable structure''. As part of those guidelines, a
family of music formats have been developed over the years.
In its flavor for common Western music notation, the MEI
format describes musical content using an XML-based syntax,
which emphasizes musical semantics.

\phdparagraph{origin of mei}

The MEI community (and format) was first presented by
\textcite{roland2002music}, where it proposed to replicate
the efforts of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) in the
musical domain. Starting in 2013, a yearly
conference\footnote{\href{https://music-encoding.org/conference/}{https://music-encoding.org/conference/}}
organized by the MEI community has perpetuated the
involvement of different people in the development of new
guidelines for music encoding
\parencite{crawford2016review}.

\phdparagraph{applications of mei}

The MEI format has gained popularity in digital collections and libraries. Thanks to tools like Verovio, the MEI music engraver by \textcite{pugin2014verovio}, several music collections have utilized the MEI format to encode their collections.
