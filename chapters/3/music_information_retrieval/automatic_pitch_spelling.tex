% This is \refsubsec{automaticpitchspelling}, which
% introduces the automatic pitch spelling.

A pitch-spelling model is an algorithm that predicts the
original spelling that a note had in a musical score when
only the pitch-class, octave, and duration of the note are
provided as inputs to the model.\footnote{Some researchers
have also found helpful to know the \emph{voice} (or
\emph{stream}, psychoacoustics) to which the note belongs
\parencite{teodoru2007pitch}. However, this information is
generally unavailable in most \gls{midi} files available
online. Therefore, algorithms of this kind should not rely
on voice information.}

\guide{A brief survey of pitch-spelling algorithms}

Compared to other \gls{mir} tasks, there are fewer
pitch-spelling algorithms available in the literature.
Because pitch-spelling is an important feature for
commercial software dealing with the conversion of
\gls{midi} files into music scores (e.g., music notation
editors). One caveat then is that other approaches may exist
among commercial applications. However, I focus on
discussing the published algorithms.

One argument for the relevance of pitch spelling in
\glspl{rna} is that recent models have benefitted from
spelling information \parencite{micchi2020not}. This is
feasible for MusicXML and similar input representations, but
not for \gls{midi} inputs, which arguably account for the
vast majority of the existing digital symbolic music files
today. Pitch spelling in parallel (or as a preprocessing
step) will thus be necessary for \glspl{rna} then.
This is also true for implementing \glspl{rna}
models in the audio domain.
