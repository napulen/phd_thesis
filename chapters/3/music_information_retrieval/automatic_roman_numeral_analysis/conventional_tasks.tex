\textcite{chen2018functional} proposed breaking a \gls{rna}
label into a set of multitask classification configuration
based on the following tonal features: local key, primary
degree, secondary degree, inversion, chord quality, and
chord root. This approach has been adopted in other research
\parencite{chen2019harmony, micchi2020not,micchi2021deep}.
