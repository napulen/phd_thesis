The (local) key describes the reference key used to
disambiguate the Roman numeral scale degrees. It is arguably
one of the most important features because if it is
mislabeled, then all \gls{rna} labels will be mislabeled.

In the initial multitask learning model by
\textcite{chen2018functional}, this task had 24 output
classes. Each of the classes represented the pitch class of
the tonic, which were encoded twice to account for major
mode keys and minor mode keys.

In a subsequent model by \textcite{micchi2020not}, the
number of classes was extended to 30, as the spelling of the
tonic pitch was taken into account (i.e., $C\sharp$ $\neq$
$D\flat$ major).
