% This is \refsubsec{automaticromannumeralanalysis}, which
% introduces the \glspl{rna}.

\gls{rna} refers to the syntax used to annotate chords,
which evolved from the use of Roman numerals in the late
eighteenth century to the complex system of the present day
(see \refchap{introductiontoromannumeralanalysis}). In
computational contexts, \glspl{rna} has been thought by
\textcite{temperley1997algorithm} as a ``chord-finding plus
key-finding'' problem. In recent years,
\textcite{chen2018functional} subdivided the problem further
into six sub-tasks: chord quality, chord root, local key,
inversion, primary degree, and secondary degree. As an
\gls{mir} problem, \glspl{rna} can be expressed as the task
of correctly predicting enough features in order to
reconstruct the correct Roman numeral labels. This problem
is challenging for various reasons (see
\refsec{challenges}). In the next section, I present a
survey of the approaches to solve this problem.
