% This is \refsubsec{automaticromannumeralanalysis}, which
% introduces the \glspl{rna}.

\gls{rna} refers to the syntax used to annotate chords,
which evolved roughly from the early nineteenth century to
the present day (see
\refchap{introductiontoromannumeralanalysis}). In
computational contexts, \glspl{rna} has been thought by
\textcite{temperley1997algorithm} as a ``chord-finding plus
key-finding'' problem. In recent years,
\textcite{chen2018functional} subdivided the problem further
into six sub-tasks: chord quality, chord root, local key,
inversion, primary degree, and secondary degree. As an
\gls{mir} problem, \glspl{rna} can be expressed as the task
of correctly predicting enough features in order to
reconstruct the correct Roman numeral labels. This problem
is challenging for various reasons (see
\refsec{challenges}). In the next section, I present a
survey of the approaches to solve this problem.

% Taken verbatim from my MSc thesis, chapter 3

% During \autoref{chap:introduction}, I defined what a
% system for automatic harmonic analysis consists of, i.e.,
% \emph{A piece of software that given a fragment of music
% as input, will output the same piece of music, with roman
% numeral labels appended to it}. At least for this
% particular work.

% I also established during \autoref{chap:dataset} that the
% musical scores used for this work are encoded using the
% \emph{Humdrum} \cite{humdrum} grammar and the roman
% numerals labeled using the \emph{**harm} \cite{harm}
% syntax. In  this chapter, I will go through a
% chronological list of attempts in conceiving a system of
% automatic harmonic analysis.

% Aftwards, I will narrow the list of attemtps, favoring the
% ones that could work with a musical score encoded in the
% humdrum grammar as input, and which can output a similar
% encoding with an appended **harm spine for the roman
% numeral labels.

% Finally, I will discuss the selected attempt and the
% reason of its preference over other similarly suitable
% attempts.

% % \section{Roman numerals} % The most important argument
% for defending roman numerals as the chosen way to label
% harmonic structures, is probably the theory that one of
% the most verbose ways of labeling harmonic structures
% %
% % Harmonic analysis could be seen from different
% perspectives, the first one I would like to address is how
% it was conceived and modeled by music theorists. Starting
% with the french composer Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764),
% until the theory from the german theorist Hugo Riemann
% (1849-1919) in the late nineteenth century. %
% \subsection{Fundamental bass} %   The original idea by
% Rameau was based on the movement of the bass note, the so
% called \emph{Fundamental Bass}, which constructed rules
% and principles of how the movement of a bass note
% determined also the movement of the harmony. Rameau's
% theory limited the dictionary of chords to triads and some
% special cases of seventh chords, and considered chord
% inversions for the first time, from which the core concept
% of harmonic root arises and suggests that the bass note
% could be serving a harmonic root located in the superior
% voices. This theory is pioneer in separating the melodic
% movement and coincidence in time from counterpoint
% \cite{beach1974origins}, and looking at the music from a
% vertical perspective, a vision that spread in the
% following periods of western art music. % \subsection{Root
% succession tables} %   These set of theories, denomined by
% Tymoczko as \emph{scale-degree} theories
% \cite{tymoczko2001root}, assign a number to each of the
% degrees in a scale, which represents its triad, and then
% trying to infer the most common succession of that
% particular scale degree to another. This theories have
% been used commonly in Harmony text books, and in
% principle, the scale-degree transitions have not been
% obtained scientifically. However, due to the probabilistic
% nature of these theories, there have been recent efforts
% in validating their statements and accuracy using
% computational resources, such as first-order Markov
% models. %   \subsection{Functional harmony} %   In 1893,
% Hugo Riemann presented his \emph{Vereinfachte
% Harmonielehre}, which placed together ideas and theories
% from himself and earlier theorists, and gave birth to what
% is called \emph{Functional Harmony}. The most notable, and
% allegedly controversial, characterization that comes from
% the functions theory, is the idea of categorization of
% chords. Functional harmony considers that chords belong to
% one of three tonal functions: %   \begin{itemize} % \item
% Tonic %     \item Subdominant %     \item Dominant %
% \end{itemize} %   These functions contain all individual
% chords, but are essentially represented by the primary
% triads: I, IV and V. %   Due to this categorization of
% chords, functional harmony contains more information about
% tonal contexts and semantics, and therefore, as an
% analysis output becomes more interesting than fundamental
% bass or root succession theories.


% \section{Overview of Automatic Harmonic Analysis}
%     \subsection{The pioneer work by Terry Winograd}
%     Researchers in the field mostly mention the approach
%     from Terry Winograd \cite{winograd1968linguistics}, in
%     1968, as the pioneer work in the task of automatic
%     harmonic analysis. This work is not only important
%     because it is the first and pioneering work in
%     computing a harmonic analysis, but also because it
%     linked the computational techniques used in natural
%     language processing to music. The model from Winograd
%     was evaluated over music from Johann Sebastian Bach,
%     and pretends to output a functional harmonic analysis
%     of such pieces of music. To provide an output, it
%     requires a preliminary hand-made conversion of the
%     original score and turn it into a sequence of
%     four-part perfect chords. This allowed him to process
%     a score using his implementation in the LISP
%     programming language, but it also means that during
%     this pre-processing stage the non-harmonic tones are
%     eliminated before solving the problem. In his 1997
%     harmonic analysis algorithm
%     \cite{temperley1997algorithm}, David Temperley
%     provided insight about the flaws of Winograd's model,
%     among them he mentions the issues concercing melodic
%     seggregation and arpeggiations.

%     \subsection{Expert system from Maxwell} A direct
%     successor of Winograd's approach, the model from John
%     Maxwell, which was part of his PhD dissertation in
%     1984, and successively published in 1992
%     \cite{maxwell1992expert}, is probably the best example
%     of the rule-based approaches towards harmonic
%     analysis. Same as Winograd, Maxwell's target was to
%     output a functional harmonic analysis from a music
%     score. The model from Maxwell has fifty five rules
%     that pretend to reduce the vertical sonorities into a
%     chord sequence, and then deciding for key changes.
%     Some of the rules are intuitive and basic, e.g.:

%     \begin{quote} \centering \emph{"Perfect and imperfect
%     consonant intervals constitute a consonant interval.
%     Every other is a dissonant interval."}, \end{quote}

%      while others appear cryptic and difficult to
%      understand, e.g.:

%      \begin{quote} \centering \emph{"If the goal chord
%      falls on a strong beat and it is a major triad or
%      major-minor seventh, and the root movement from the
%      pre-cadence is an ascending or descending perfect
%      fifth or major second or a descending minor second,
%      and when the root motion is a descending fifth, the
%      pre-cadence is not a potential dominant, and when the
%      root motion is an ascending fifth the pre-cadence is
%      triadic, then the pseudo-cadence is a half cadence,
%      and its strength increases by 10."}. \end{quote}

%     The later rule also reveals a problem that was pointed
%     out by future researchers, the use of arbitrary, fixed
%     values while determining the strength of a cadence.

%     Even so, the results of Maxwell's approach get really
% 	    close to the outcome expected by a music theorist
% 	    analyzing a music score and determining its
% 	    functional harmony. This work was tested over three
% 	    different movements of Johann Sebastian Bach's Six
% 	    French Suites: The sarabande from Suite No.1, the
% 	    menuet from Suite No.2 and the gavotte from Suite
% 	    No.5. The pieces selected comprehend different
% 	    problems and levels of complexity to be addressed:
% 	    Four-part harmony with several non-harmonic tones,
% 	    2-voice continuous contrapuntual movement, and a
% 	    varying contrapuntual texture, respectively. David
% 	    Temperley listed the limitations of Winograd and
% 	    Maxwell's approaches similarly, summarizing them in
% 	    the following: \begin{itemize} \item Sequences of
% 	    notes that are not displayed simultaneously
% 	    (vertically), as arpeggiations of chords. \item
% 	    Missing pitches in the spelling of a full chord,
% 	    which can be deduced from the context. \item
% 	    Ornamental notes. Maxwell proposes specific rules to
% 	    deal with these notes, but according to Temperley,
% 	    neither Maxwell's or Winograd's are good enough to
% 	    correctly detect ornamental notes. \end{itemize}
% 	    Maxwell's approach, in general, represents the
% 	    powerful and sophisticated machinery of rule-based
% 	    approaches, as well as their complexity.

%     \subsection{Temperley and the Melisma Music Analyzer}
%     Probably the most relevant approach in automatic
%     harmonic analysis for this work, is the approach from
%     David Temperley described in 1997
%     \cite{temperley1997algorithm}, as it was extended
%     afterwards by his work in key estimation algorithms
%     and which culminated in the implementation of the
%     Melisma Music Analyzer, in conjunction with Daniel
%     Sleator. Inspired by the cognitive experiments by
%     Carol Krumhansl \cite{krumhansl2001cognitive}, the aim
%     of Temperley is to produce an algorithm that models
%     the human process of harmonic analysis done by a
%     trained expert, and to take it as indicative of the
%     analysis produced subconsciously by listeners in
%     general.

% 		The traiditional functional harmonic analysis done
% 		in music theory courses uses the \emph{roman
% 		numerals} notation to segment a piece of music,
% 		labeling it with symbols indicating the relationship
% 		between each root to the current key. Temperley
% 		steps forward in the definition of the problem of
% 		harmonic analysis, decomposing the task into two
% 		subtasks: \emph{root finding} and \emph{key
% 		finding}. Temperley claims then that functional
% 		harmonic analysis could be broken down into these
% 		subtasks, focusing at first in root finding,
% 		assuming that this task can be done independently to
% 		key finding. Root finding basically consists of
% 		dividing a piece into segments and label each of
% 		them with a root.

%     Once in the task of root-finding, Temperley approaches
%     the task defining certain rules: \emph{Pitch variance
%     rule, compatibility rule, strong-beat rule, harmonic
%     variance rule and ornamental dissonance rule}.
%     Together with these rules, he introduces important
%     definitions that aid in the process of root analysis:
%     The concepts of \emph{Tonal Pitch Class} (TPC),
%     \emph{Center of Gravity} (COG) and the \emph{line of
%     fifths}.

%     It is difficult to follow the chronology of this
%     approach, as the implementation of this model comes
%     mainly in the form of the Melisma Music Analyzer,
%     which was released in 2001, and included the key
%     estimation algorithm and a combined mode that
%     eventually performed the complete functional harmonic
%     analysis. The latest mode being the core
%     implementation of what will be used to compute
%     automatic harmonic analysis during this work.

%     \subsection{Probabilistic and statistical approaches}
%     Temperley himself, after the release of the Melisma
%     Music Analyzer, moved into the direction of
%     probabilistic models. In his case, using a Bayesian
%     approach that aims to provide a unified modeling of
%     harmonic analysis, meter induction and melodic
%     seggregation, challenging the individualization of
%     these problems without considering the connections
%     among them \cite{temperley2009unified}.

%     Another important probabilistic approach that emerged
%     to solve the problem of functional harmonic analysis
%     was that of Christopher Raphael
%     \cite{raphael2003harmonic}. This model from Raphael is
%     one of the few pure-functional harmonic analysis
%     approaches, oriented towards the analysis of
%     common-practice music. The idea is simple and some of
%     his assumptions simplify the parameters of the model.
%     Some constant that remains as in previous models is
%     the fact that it gets rid of all the pitch-spelling
%     information and replaced for solely pitch information.
%     This model, unlike Temperley, does not try to
%     reconstruct the pitch spelling information back by any
%     algorithmic means, and in the words of Raphael, it is
%     an obvious extension to the model.

%     Another quite important effort in the statistical
%     domain includes the work from Martin Rohrmeier
%     \cite{rohrmeier2008statistical}, who uses a heuristic
%     method of segmentation. Analyzes distributions of
%     single pitch-class-sets, chord classes and
%     pitch-class-sets transitions. One of the goals of
%     Rohrmeier was the research of \emph{syntacticality} in
%     harmony. The final goal is to produce descriptive
%     analyses of harmonic structure based on an empirical
%     approach. The choice of the corpus is, similarly to
%     others, music from Joahann Sebastian Bach. In his
%     case, chorales, because they constitute a large and
%     coherent set of pieces regarding style and composition
%     technique. Rohrmeier claims that this work is pioneer
%     in the statistical analysis of a corpus for the
%     purpose of finding features of tonal harmony.
%     According to the results of Rohrmeier, the most
%     frequent occurrences of pitch-class-sets in this music
%     are those of tonic, dominant and subdominant chords.
%     This would be expected and helps to reinforce those
%     scale-degree theories that describe harmonic movement
%     with transition tables of scale degrees. The results
%     from this research, apart from being interesting in
%     confirming music-theory beliefs regarding common
%     chords and transitions in tonal music, could also be
%     replicated in a different corpus to target its
%     particular common chords and transitions.

%     \subsection{Grammar-based} Three years after his
%     statistical work in Bach Chorales, Martin Rohrmeier
%     brought back the use of grammars to study the
%     underlying structure of musical harmony
%     \cite{rohrmeier2011towards}, which inspired future
%     works by other researchers in the field, specially
%     towards analyzing jazz music. In this work, Rohrmeier
%     claims that the structure of harmonic progressions
%     exceeds the simplicity of a markovian transition
%     table, and he proposes a set of phrase-structure
%     grammar rules. For this purpose, the hierarchical
%     analysis from the music-theory approach done by
%     \cite{kostka1995tonal} is presented, with the belief
%     that it can be brought to a closer formalization.
%     Rohrmeier presents a tree representation of a chord
%     sequence, using two principles: \begin{itemize} \item
%     Chords have dependencies and the existence of one
%     sometimes requires the existence of another \item
%     Chords have functions, these functions can be realized
%     by a set of chords. \end{itemize} The system comprises
%     27 rules for the generation of a grammar, this helps
%     to model common-practice music as well as jazz music.
%     The output of this algorithm is a hierarchical tree of
%     the functions and dependencies of the chords. The
%     level of detail from this work to model every special
%     case of the harmonic language is remarkable, as
%     careful attention has been put trying to comprehend
%     distinct kinds of cadences, chords and modulations in
%     the model.

%     This work was eventually retaken and implemented by
%     Bas de Haas \cite{de2013automatic} using chord labels
%     as input for the system.

%     As discussed previously, after I have overviewed the
%     works in harmonic analysis, I will now narrow down the
%     list of attempts that are most relevant to the
%     expectations of this work. Among the most important
%     factors that lead to separate the \emph{favorite}
%     attempts from the rest, I could list two: The first
%     one, being the capability of the system to deal with
%     full scores as input, instead of a list of chord
%     labels. The second, being the capability of the system
%     to exploit, infer or reconstruct the pitch-spelling
%     information from the original score in the output of
%     the analyzed score.

%   \section{Narrowing down the approaches} From the
%   previously mentioned efforts of harmonic analysis, those
%   that fit the best with the expected inputs and outputs
%   of this work, are the following: \begin{table}[tbp]
%   \centering \begin{tabular}{llll} Approach & Year &
%   Implementation & Availability \\
%       Winograd & 1968 & LISP & No \\
%       Maxwell & 1992 & LISP & No \\
%       Temperley & 1997\footnote{The span of time between
%       this approach was presented as a paper and the
%       current implentation used for this work, is much
%       wider, reaching changes in code done during 2017} &
%       C & Yes \\
%       Raphael & 2003 & C & Partial \\
%       Illescas & 2008 & Java & Partial \end{tabular}
%     \caption{Automatic functional harmonic analysis
%     approaches} \label{table:shortlist_models} \end{table}

%   From the approaches shown in
%   \autoref{table:shortlist_models}, I decided to choose
%   the model and implementation from David Temperley's
%   algorithm to be run over the dataset of String Quartets
%   Op.20.

%   The most important reason for this selection is because
%   this is the approach with the most mature
%   implementation, and the effort for getting humdrum
%   scores to be analyzed using it is the minimum of all the
%   other attemtps.

% taken verbatim from my MSc thesis, chapter 4

% As I described during \autoref{chap:literature-review},
% the original model from David Temperley divided a system
% of automatic harmonic analysis in two subsystems: One that
% performs root detection and another one that performs key
% detection. \autoref{fig:software_stack1} shows how the
% core harmonic analysis of David Temperley comprises these
% two tasks.

% \begin{figure}[ht] \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{04-methodology/figures/1}
%   \caption{Harmonic analysis as divided by David
%   Temperley} \label{fig:software_stack1} \end{figure}

% However, thanks to the implementation work that has been
% already done by David Temperley, Daniel Sleator and Craig
% Sapp, the idea of using an implementation of this
% automatic harmonic analysis system over the dataset
% described in this work, which consists of musical scores
% encoded in humdrum files, is already feasible. During this
% chapter I will introduce the software stack, programs and
% scripts that allow for running an automatic harmonic
% analysis of a humdrum music score.

% I will start from the analysis programs of the Melisma
% Music Analyzer, which are the core of the analysis, to the
% scripts and programs of the Humdrum Extras software tools
% that allow for the use of real humdrum music scores.

% \section{The Melisma Music Analyzer} The Melisma Music
%   Analyzer was implemented by Daniel Sleator over the work
%   of David Temperley. It takes as input a \emph{Notefile},
%   which could be said to be a plain-text representation of
%   midi files. The Melisma Music Analyzer consists of
%   several standalone programs, therefore, the output
%   depends on the program that is being run over the
%   \emph{Notefile} input file. However, generally speaking,
%   they all output a plain-text analysis of some sort.

%   In order to obtain a harmonic analysis, a Notefile needs
%   to go through 3 stand-alone programs, one after another:
%   Meter, Harmony and Key.

%   \begin{figure}[ht] \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{04-methodology/figures/2}
%     \caption{Melisma Music Analyzer, from a Notefile to a
%     plain-text analysis} \label{fig:software_stack2}
%     \end{figure}

%   \subsection{Meter} This program extracts metrical
%     information about the musical piece, using the
%     theories of the Generative Theory of Tonal Music as a
%     basis. The output of this program is the same notefile
%     with beat information appended at the end.
%     \subsection{Harmony} This program takes as input the
%     notefile with beat information (the output from the
%     meter program), and outputs information about harmonic
%     roots for each beat. The name is somehow misleading,
%     as this program's output is not harmony, but a
%     harmonic root. Temperley divided the task of harmonic
%     analysis in root estimation and key estimation, this
%     program computing the first of these subtasks.
%     \subsection{Key} This program takes as input the
%     notefile with beat and harmonic-root information (the
%     ouput from the harmony program). Something to remark
%     about this program is that it might work with or
%     without the information of the harmony program. In the
%     first case, it performs a complete harmonic analysis.
%     In the second case, it will only perform a key
%     estimation.

%     \autoref{fig:software_stack2} shows the flow from an
%     input Notefile to the plain-text analysis that is
%     being output by the key estimation program of the
%     Melisma Music Analyzer.

%   \subsection{Problems with processing Notefile files} The
%     input format from the Melisma Music Analyzer, yet it
%     resembles a midi file, it is not a midi file. It is
%     also not a standard type of file that could be
%     encountered typically in other software. More
%     important, it is incompatible with the humdrum
%     encoding of the dataset used for this work, so at this
%     point, we are unable to run an analysis over these
%     musical scores.

%     However, there is one way around this problem. Using
%     one of the programs found in the \emph{Humdrum extras}
%     collection.

% \section{Humdrum extras} The humdrum extras are a set of
%   tools developed by Craig Sapp, mainly in the C++
%   programming language \cite{humextra}. These tools are
%   useful for additional processing of musical scores
%   encoded in humdrum. For this work, I am particularly
%   interested in a few of these utilities that help to pass
%   a humdrum file to the melisma music analyzer, and then
%   bring the output from melisma back to a humdrum
%   representation.

%   \begin{figure}[ht] \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{04-methodology/figures/3}
%     \caption{Automatic harmonic analysis of a humdrum
%     musical score} \label{fig:software_stack3}
%     \end{figure}

%   The first step is mitigating the problem around the
%   Notefile format, for this, the \emph{kern2melisma}
%   program from the Humdrum Extras collection results quite
%   useful.

%   \subsection{kern2melisma} This program provides a parser
%     to convert a humdrum file into the \emph{Notefile}
%     format used by Melisma. It is the first step in the
%     workflow of a functional harmonic analysis from a
%     humdrum score.

%   Once the input file is able to be processed over the
%   programs of the Melisma Music Analyzer, it will be
%   possible to obtain the plain-text analysis of the
%   \emph{Key} program. However, this analysis is difficult
%   to parse as it is. Luckily, there is already a tool from
%   the Humdrum Extras that provides help parsing this
%   analysis, this tool is the \emph{key2humdrum} script,
%   written in PERL.

%   \subsection{key2humdrum} This program takes the output
%     from the \emph{Key} program and outputs a
%     pseudo-humdrum representation.

%   \subsection{Appending to a humdrum file} The last step
%     in getting the information back into a humdrum file is
%     parsing the output of the key2humdrum program and
%     appending this information to a humdrum spine. This
%     process is not done by a standalone program, but
%     rather a program that comprehends all the process
%     described during this chapter. This program is called
%     \emph{tsroot}.

%   \subsection{tsroot} The tsroot programs performs all the
%     steps described before, starting from calling the
%     \emph{kern2melisma} to calling the Melisma programs
%     and \emph{key2humdrum}. Additionally, this program
%     also interprets the output of key2humdrum and produces
%     a final humdrum score with the analysis information
%     appended to it.

%     \autoref{fig:software_stack3} could be seen as the
%     process that happens each time the \emph{tsroot}
%     program is run over a humdrum score. This is a
%     truthful realization of the target system for
%     automatic harmonic analysis explained in the first
%     chapters of this document.
