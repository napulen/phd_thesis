% This is \refsubsec{automaticchordrecognition}, which
% introduces the automatic chord recognition.

\gls{acr} has been explored thoroughly in the field of
\gls{mir}. \gls{acr} systems usually predict the root and
quality of the chords throughout a piece of music via either
an audio or a symbolic representation. \gls{acr} is arguably
one of the most widely explored topics in \gls{mir}. In this
dissertation, an emphasis on chord labelling systems that
are related to \gls{rna} is offered in
\refsubsec{automaticromannumeralanalysis}. For a more
general overview of \gls{acr} models, please refer to the
historical summaries presented by \textcite{pauwels201920}
for audio and \textcite[p. 58--88]{ju2021addressing} for
symbolic.
