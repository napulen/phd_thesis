% introduces the automatic chord recognition.

\gls{acr} has been explored thoroughly in the field of
\gls{mir}. \gls{acr} systems usually predict the root and
quality of the chords throughout a piece of music via either
an audio or a symbolic representation. \gls{acr} is arguably
one of the most widely explored topics in \gls{mir}. In this
dissertation, with an emphasis on \gls{rna}, the \gls{acr}
methods that are directly related to \gls{rna} models are
described in \refsubsec{automaticromannumeralanalysis}. For
a more historical overview of general \gls{acr} models,
please refer to the summaries presented by
\textcite{pauwels201920} for audio and \textcite[p.
58--88]{ju2021addressing} for symbolic.
