\gls{acr} has been explored thoroughly in the field of
\gls{mir}. \gls{acr} systems usually predict the root and
quality of the chords throughout a piece of music via either
an audio or a symbolic representation. \gls{acr} are
arguably one of the most widely explored topics in
\gls{mir}. Thus, for a historical overview of \gls{acr}
models, please refer to the summaries by
\textcite{pauwels201920} and \textcite{ju2021addressing}.
