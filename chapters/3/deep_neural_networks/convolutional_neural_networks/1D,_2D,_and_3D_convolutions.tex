Originally, \glspl{cnn} were proposed to deal with images,
which are encoded in a two-dimensional grid of pixels.
However, one-dimensional \glspl{cnn} and three-dimensional
architectures now exist, which can be applied to, for
example, timeseries (1D tensors) and video data (3D
tensors), respectively.
