% This is \refsubsec{supervisedlearning}, which introduces
% the supervised learning.


\textcite{goodfellow2016deep} describe supervised learning
algorithms as

\begin{italicquotes}
    algorithms that learn to associate some input with some
    output, given a training set of examples of inputs $x$
    and outputs $y$.
\end{italicquotes}

Commonly, the outputs are provided by a human annotator
(``supervisor''), which is the case, for example, regarding
\gls{rna} annotations provided by human experts.
