% This is \refsubsec{supervisedlearning},
% which introduces the supervised learning.


\textcite{goodfellow2016deep} define supervised learning algorithms as ``algorithms that learn to associate some input with some output, given a
training set of examples of inputs $x$ and outputs $y$.'' Commonly, the outputs are provided by a human annotator (``supervisor''), which is true for annotations of Roman numeral analysis.
