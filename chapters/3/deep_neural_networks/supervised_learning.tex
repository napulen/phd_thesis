% This is \refsubsec{supervisedlearning}, which introduces
% the supervised learning.


\textcite[140]{goodfellow2016deep} describe supervised learning
algorithms as

\begin{italicsquote}
    algorithms that learn to associate some input with some
    output, given a training set of examples of inputs \textbf{x}
    and outputs \textbf{y}.
\end{italicsquote}

Commonly, the outputs are provided by a human annotator
(``supervisor''), which in the case of \gls{rna}
annotations, refers to the expert annotators providing the
analyses.
