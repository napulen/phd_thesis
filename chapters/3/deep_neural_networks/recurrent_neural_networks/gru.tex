% This is \refsubsubsec{gru}, which introduces the gru.

The \gls{gru} is a more recent recurrent architecture
introduced by \textcite{cho2014learning}. It is simpler than
the \gls{lstm} and, similarly, can generally be used as a
substitute of \gls{rnn} or \gls{lstm} layers with similar
(or better) results.
