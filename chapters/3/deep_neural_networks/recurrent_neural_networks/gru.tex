% This is \refsubsubsec{gru}, which introduces the gru.

The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a more recent recurrent
architecture introduced by \textcite{cho2014learning}.

It is simpler than the LSTM and, similarly, can generally be
used as a substitute of RNN or LSTM layers with similar (or
better) results.
