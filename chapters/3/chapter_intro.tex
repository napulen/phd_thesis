% This is the introduction to \refchap{background}, which
% goes before any of its sections.

In this chapter, we introduce the previous work on music
technology, machine learning, and \gls{mir}, that is
relevant for \glspl{rna}. \refsec{musicrepresentation}
introduces the idea of music representation and symbolic
music formats, which are the input to an \glspl{rna} system.
\refsec{deepneuralnetworks} briefly introduces the concepts
of supervised learning and common neural network
architectures that are used in symbolic music analysis
problems. \refsec{musicinformationretrieval} introduces the
existing \gls{mir} techniques for \glspl{rna} and related
problems: key estimation, automatic chord recognition, and
pitch spelling.
