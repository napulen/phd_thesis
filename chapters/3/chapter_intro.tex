% This is the introduction to \refchap{background}, which
% goes before any of its sections.

In this chapter, we introduce the previous work on music
technology, machine learning, and music information
retrieval, that is relevant for automatic Roman numeral
analysis. \refsec{musicrepresentation} introduces the idea
of music representation and symbolic music formats, which
are the input to an \glspl{rna} system.
\refsec{deepneuralnetworks} briefly introduces the concepts
of supervised learning and common neural network
architectures that are used in symbolic music analysis
problems. \refsec{musicinformationretrieval} introduces the
existing \gls{mir} techniques for \glspl{rna}
and its satellite problems: key estimation, automatic chord
recognition, and pitch spelling.
