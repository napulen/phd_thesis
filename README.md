Today, I started the journey. I revised the theses from Gabriel Vigliensoni, Andrew Hankinson, and Ivan Franco. I was looking for a McGill PhD thesis template. What I found is that all these thesis have a different style (margins, font, layout, etc). There seems not to be a general template available.

I decided to recycle the project that I used for my comps.

I started writing some titles. 

I realized how difficult it is to think of a title. Broad. I could write about anything and it sounds related to what I am doing. It is quite a good exercise, actually.

I ran a short estimation of the words in each of those theses. A succesful PhD dissertation in my program has around 80,000 to 90,000 words.

In the examples I saw, it seems that around 10% of the thesis' pages are blank pages, references, and table of contents. Around 90% of the pages comprise the main content of the work.

If I distributed those 80,000 words through the year, I would have to write 219 words each day to finish my thesis.

This text entry, from the begining to the end, has 271 words.

I will schedule myself ~250 words each day, about my current thoughts and concerns. It will be a good exercise for both, revisiting my thoughts in the future and getting into the habit of writing.

The next topic that I want to think about is the name and number of chapters in my dissertation. I foresee that this harmony and key duality will continue to be an issue until I put it to an end in writing.
