Beside this the symmetry model is proposed as a framework to describe the inter-model relationships between different circular pitch spaces. Similar to color spaces in vision musical pitch spaces organize pitches in a way that semantic/cognitive/theoretical/physical relationships between tones become geometrically apparent.

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {For over 50 years, researchers have been trying to teach computers to read music notation, referred to as Optical Music Recognition ({OMR}). However, this field is still difficult to access for new researchers, especially those without a significant musical background: Few introductory materials are available, and, furthermore, the field has struggled with defining itself and building a shared terminology. In this work, we address these shortcomings by (1) providing a robust definition of {OMR} and its relationship to related fields, (2) analyzing how {OMR} inverts the music encoding process to recover the musical notation and the musical semantics from documents, and (3) proposing a taxonomy of {OMR}, with most notably a novel taxonomy of applications. Additionally, we discuss how deep learning affects modern {OMR} research, as opposed to the traditional pipeline. Based on this work, the reader should be able to attain a basic understanding of {OMR}: its objectives, its inherent structure, its relationship to other fields, the state of the art, and the research opportunities it affords.},

	abstract = {This dissertation addresses the question of how musical pitches generate a tonal center. Being able to characterize the relationships that generate a tonal center is crucial to the computer analysis and the generating of western tonal music. It also can inform issues of compositional styles, structural boundaries, and performance decisions. The proposed Spiral Array model offers a parsimonious description of the inter-relations among tonal elements, and suggests new ways to re-conceptualize and reorganize musical information. The Spiral Array generates representations for pitches, intervals, chords and keys within a single spatial framework, allowing comparisons among elements from different hierarchical levels. Structurally, this spatial representation is a helical realization of the harmonic network (tonnetz). The basic idea behind the Spiral Array is the representation of higher level tonal elements as composites of their lower level parts. The Spiral Array assigns greatest prominence to perfect fifth and major /minor third interval relations, placing elements related by these intervals in proximity to each other. As a result, distances between tonal entities as represented spatially in the model correspond to perceived distances among sounding entities. The parameter values that affect proximity relations are prescribed based on a few perceived relations among pitches, intervals, chords and keys. This process of interfacing between the model and actual perception creates the opportunity to research some basic, but till now unanswered questions about the relationships that generate tonality. A generative model, the Spiral Array case; provides a framework on which to design viable and efficient algorithms for problems in music cognition. I demonstrate its versatility by applying the model to three different problems: I develop an algorithm to determine the key of musical passages that, on average, performs better than existing ones when applied to the 24 fugue subjects in Book I of Bach's {WTC}; I propose the first computationally viable method for determining modulations (the change of key); and, I design a basic algorithm for finding the roots of chords, comparing its results to those of algorithms by other researchers. All three algorithms were implemented in Matlab.},

	abstract = {Long after his major writings on harmony, counterpoint and analysis began to appear, Heinrich Schenker (1868–1935) remains one of the most important and influential theorists in the history of Western music. His achievements have often been compared to those of eminent thinkers of his age working in other fields, e.g., his Viennese compatriots Sigmund Freud in psychology and Albert Einstein in physics. His influence, modest (though not negligible) in his own lifetime, has grown steadily since the middle of the last century and shows no signs of abating. Already a paradigmatic figure in North American universities by the 1970s, he has since exerted a powerful influence in British and, more recently, European academic circles. Indeed, the interest shown in his life’s work is, in some respects, comparable to that of some of the twentieth century’s leading composers, and in this respect his reputation as a theorist is unequaled.That which is called “Schenkerian theory” is a complex set of regulatory principles that were initially intended to explain the tonal music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; it is at the same time a synthesis of many traditions, embracing Fuxian counterpoint, the thorough-bass teaching of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and late nineteenth-century harmonic theory. It is at once a sophisticated explanation of tonality, but also an analytical system of immense empirical power. Schenker’s ideas and work touch on, or have implications for, virtually every topic addressed in this volume.This chapter includes a synopsis of Schenker’s life and works, an explanation of the rudiments of his theory, remarks on its historical background, and a survey of its reception both as a pedagogical tool and as a basis for further investigation of a wide range of music.},

	shorttitle = {Nineteenth-century harmonic theory},
	abstract = {Today most scholars agree that Rameau was the founder of modern harmonic theory. As we have seen in the previous chapter, Rameau attempted to synthesize in his many writings a multiplicity of ideas – both old and new, speculative and practical – into a unified theory of tonal harmony grounded upon a single underlying principle, the corps sonore (see Chapter 24, pp. 759–71). If he did not succeed in creating a truly systematic and stable theory of harmony owing to his many differing and often contradictory theoretical arguments and intellectual borrowings, he nonetheless bequeathed to the nineteenth century a number of compelling and richly suggestive ideas that would inspire theorists in their own efforts.In this chapter, we will look at the evolution of harmonic theory in the nineteenth century. This is of course a vast and complex topic. Given the profound changes in harmonic language between 1800 and 1900 – a period covering the end of Viennese Classicism and closing with Schoenberg’s first tentative steps beyond the tonal system – it is not surprising that theorists expended extraordinary energy and efforts in their attempts to rationalize this shifting practice. As it is impossible here to describe all of these efforts in detail, we will limit our scope to the development of Austro-German harmonic theory, a tradition which arguably encompasses some of the most innovative and influential writings on this topic for the entire century. Within this tradition, three individual trajectories can be traced back by differing routes to Rameau’s own theory: scale-degree (Stufen) theory, fundamental-bass theory, and function theory.},

	abstract = {The more complex a natural entity is, and the more interrelated its components are, the harder it often is for us to comprehend how it could have evolved from completely independent constituent elements. Human vision, for instance, is so immensely complex, with numerous specialized parts both in the eye itself and in the way that the brain processes visual signals, that it is difficult to imagine how each component evolved both separately and in interaction with its affiliates before the final, highly integrated developmental stage existed. The same is true of complex cultural systems that have evolved over long periods of time, among which is harmonic tonality. Virtually every aspect of harmonic tonality (tertian harmonies as primary compositional structures, contrapuntal voice leading connecting those harmonies, the bass as a harmonic foundation, notions of root generation, harmonic motion directed toward cadential goals, the interaction of diatonic scales and chromaticism, and the interaction of harmony and counterpoint with rhythm and meter) arose before tonal harmonic syntax existed. Even though those components interact quite intricately in tonal music, each arose within different musical contexts, and each was explained autonomously by teachings having long, independent theoretical traditions.The individual who first recognized that all those components interacted to create a sense of tonality was the French theorist and composer Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683–1764). Although Rameau proposed some original ideas, a major part of his theorizing in the treatises he published between 1722 and 1761 consisted of reformulating and combining long-standing concepts into a single harmonic, directional perspective. Rameau is an instance of that relatively rare theorist who was a major composer as well. Because of this, as much as he pursued theoretical ideas for their own consistency, he generally remembered that the function of a theory of harmony was to explain music as he understood it compositionally. This chapter traces many of these concepts and their attendant pedagogical traditions as inherited by the early eighteenth century, and then considers Rameau’s brilliant accomplishment of consolidating them into a unified (if not completely stabilized) harmonic theory. Lastly, this chapter surveys the evolving legacy of this now-dominant heritage in the late eighteenth century and beyond.},

	abstract = {As a music-theoretical term, “tonality” was first used by Alexander Choron in 1810 to describe the arrangement of the dominant and subdominant above and below the tonic and thus to differentiate the harmonic organization of modern music (tonalité moderne) from that of earlier music (tonalité antique). One of the main conceptual categories in Western musical thought, tonality most often refers to the orientation of melodies and harmonies toward a referential (or tonic) pitch class. In the broadest possible sense, however, it refers to systematic arrangements of pitch phenomena and relations between them.{UsageA} number of musical and discursive factors have contributed to a veritable profusion of definitions for the term. To begin with, there has been considerable indecision about what musical domain the term covers: whether it applies to both Western and non-Western music, or whether, within Western musical traditions, the term can be restricted to the harmonic organization of music from the so-called common practice (1600–1910) or includes all music that evinces a basic difference between consonance and dissonance. There have also been some basic theoretical disagreements about whether its constituent musical elements are melodies or harmonies: however narrow the definition given to the term, the domain of tonal music is so enormous, diverse, and complex that one can choose almost any combination of musical phenomena and theoretical principles as the basis for discussion. In addition to these musical problems, enormous discursive difficulties have arisen from the conceptual languages used to describe tonal phenomena, theoretical vocabularies that vary dramatically according to the aesthetic and epistemological commitments of the writer.},

	abstract = {Key finding is an integral step in content-based music indexing and retrieval. In this paper, we present an O(n) real-time algorithm for determining key from polyphonic audio. We use the standard Fast Fourier Transform with a local maximum detection scheme to extract pitches and pitch strengths from polyphonic audio. Next, we use Chew's Spiral Array Center of Effect Generator ({CEG}) algorithm to determine the key from pitch strength information. We test the proposed system using Mozart's Symphonies. The test data is audio generated from {MIDI} source. The algorithm achieves a maximum correct key recognition rate of 96\% within the first fifteen seconds, and exceeds 90\% within the first three seconds. Starting from the extracted pitch strength information, we compare the {CEG} algorithm's performance to the classic Krumhansl-Schmuckler (K-S) probe tone profile method and Temperley's modified version of the K-S method. Correct key recognition rates for the K-S and modified K-S methods remain under 50\% in the first three seconds, with maximum values of 80\% and 87\% respectively within the first fifteen seconds for the same test set. The {CEG} method consistently scores higher throughout the fifteen-second selections.},

	abstract = {We explore the ability of a very simple artificial neural network, a perceptron, to assert the musical key of novel stimuli. First, perceptrons are trained to associate standardized key profiles (taken from 1 of 3 different sources) to different musical keys. After training, we measured perceptron accuracy in asserting musical keys for 296 novel stimuli. Depending upon which key profiles were used during training, perceptrons can perform as well as established key-finding algorithms on this task. Further analyses indicate that perceptrons generate higher activity in a unit representing a selected key and much lower activities in the units representing the competing keys that are not selected than does a traditional algorithm. Finally, we examined the internal structure of trained perceptrons and discovered that they, unlike traditional algorithms, assign very different weights to different components of a key profile. Perceptrons learn that some profile components are more important for specifying musical key than are others. These differential weights could be incorporated into traditional algorithms that do not themselves employ artificial neural networks.

	abstract = {We have already shown that extracting long-term dependencies from sequential data is difficult, both for determimstic dynamical systems such as recurrent networks, and probabilistic models such as hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) or input/output hidden Markov models ({IOHMMs}). In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables representing past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for {HMMs} and {IOHMMs}.},

	abstract = {We present a new measure for automatically estimating the confidence of musical key classification. Our approach leverages the degree of harmonic information held within a musical audio signal (its "keyness") as well as the steadiness of local key detections across the its duration (its "stability"). Using this confidence measure, musical tracks which are likely to be misclassified, i.e. those with low confidence, can then be handled differently from those analysed by standard, fully automatic key detection methods. By means of a listening test, we demonstrate that our developed features significantly correlate with listeners' ratings of harmonic complexity, steadiness and the uniqueness of key. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tracks which are incorrectly labelled using an existing key detection system obtain low confidence values. Finally, we introduce a new method called "root note heuristics" for the special treatment of tracks with low confidence. We show that by applying these root note heuristics, key detection results can be improved for minimalistic music.},

This model maps 12-bin chroma vectors to the interior space of a 6-D polytope; pitch classes are mapped onto the vertices of this polytope. Close harmonic relations such as fifths and thirds appear as small Euclidian distances. We calculate the Euclidian distance between analysis frames n +1 and n -1 to develop a harmonic change measure for frame n. A peak in the detection function denotes a transition from one harmonically stable region to another. Initial experiments show that the algorithm can successfully detect harmonic changes such as chord boundaries in polyphonic audio recordings.},

	abstract = {This article describes a new expert-labelled dataset featuring harmonic, phrase, and cadence analyses of all piano sonatas by W.A. Mozart. The dataset draws on the {DCML} standard for harmonic annotation and is being published adopting the {FAIR} principles of Open Science. The annotations have been verified using a data triangulation procedure which is presented as an alternative approach to handling annotator subjectivity. This procedure is suited for ensuring consistency, within the dataset and beyond, despite the high level of analytical detail afforded by the employed harmonic annotation syntax. The harmony labels also encode contextual information and are therefore suited for investigating music theoretical questions related to tonal harmony and the harmonic makeup of cadences in the classical style. Apart from providing basic statistical analyses characterizing the dataset, its music theoretical potential is illustrated by two preliminary experiments, one on the terminal harmonies of cadences and the other on the relation between performance durations and harmonic density. Furthermore, particular features can be selected to produce more coarse-grained training data, for example for chord detection algorithms that require less analytical detail. Facilitating the dataset’s reusability, it comes with a Python script that allows researchers to easily access various representations of the data tailored to their particular needs.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Here, we abandon typical conventions and adopt a different perspective of the problem, where several seconds of pitch spectra are classified directly by a convolutional neural network. Using labeled data to train the system in a supervised manner, we achieve state of the art performance through this initial effort in an otherwise unexplored area. Subsequent error analysis provides insight into potential areas of improvement, and this approach to chord recognition shows promise for future harmonic analysis systems.},

The study proposes a tool for determination of a time dependent tonal context vector for melodies from acoustical input. Each element of this vector, called a tonal component, indicates the extent of a specific scale usage. The system is made up of two stages: The first is involved in digital signal processing and is used to convert sound input of melodies into a sequence of musical note intervals and their associated occurrence times. The second stage uses finite state automats to match patterns of the interval sequences with pre-programmed scale patterns. The output consists of a time dependent tonal context vector whose elements are relative strengths of various tonal components regarding the melody under consideration.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {24 undergraduates rated test tones in the octave range from middle to high C according to how well each completed a diatonic C major scale played in an adjacent octave just before the final test tone. Ratings were well explained in terms of 3 factors: distance in pitch height from the context tones, octave equivalence, and a hierarchy of tonal functions (tonic tone, other tones of the major triad chord, other tones of the diatonic scale, and the nondiatonic tones). In these ratings, pitch height was more prominent for less musical listeners or with less musical (sinusoidal) tones, whereas octave equivalence and the tonal hierarchy prevailed for musical listeners, especially with harmonically richer tones. In a 2nd experiment with 8 undergraduates, ratings for quarter tones interpolated halfway between the halftone steps of the standard chromatic scale were approximately the averages of ratings for adjacent chromatic tones, suggesting failure to discriminate tones at this fine level of division.

	abstract = {Investigated the cognitive representation of harmonic and tonal structure in Western music using a tone-profile technique in 2 experiments with 24 undergraduates and community adults. Listeners rated how well single tones (any one of the 12 tones of the chromatic scale) followed a musical element such as a scale, chord, or cadence. Stable rating profiles reflecting the tonal hierarchies in major and minor keys were obtained, which, when intercorrelated and analyzed using multidimensional scaling, produced a 4-dimensional spatial map of the distances between keys. Listeners integrated harmonic functions over multiple chords, developing a sense of key that needed to be re-evaluated as additional chords were sounded. It is suggested that the perceived relations between chords and keys and between different keys are mediated through an internal representation of the hierarchy of tonal functions of single tones in music.

	abstract = {Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch considers the problem of how listeners encode, organize, and remember pitch patterns in music. The work seeks to explicate the nature of listeners' knowledge of how pitch structures are formed, identify musical properties that shape this knowledge, and characterize the process through which sequences of sounds become coherent, memorable, and meaningful. The approach taken is that of cognitive psychology, in which laboratory methods examine the nature of mental representations and processes. Previous publications have described a number of the studies. They are summarized here together with new results, allowing richer connections to be drawn between the empirical findings. Theoretical and methodological issues surrounding the laboratory studies are also examined. The experiments focus primarily on pitch structures in traditional Western music. This choice of focus is based on the large corpus of literature in music theory that deals with this style. This literature has been important for designing the experimental materials and interpreting the results. A number of studies extend the methods to music outside this tradition. Throughout, care has been taken to provide adequate background in experimental methods and music theory so that no special background is needed to follow the major arguments. However, the reader will naturally discover certain topics to be of greater interest than others depending on his or her special expertise.

The choice of chord profiles and higher-level time-series modelling have received a lot of attention, resulting in methods with an overall performance of more than 70\% in the {MIREX} Chord Detection task 2009. Research on the front end of chord transcription algorithms has often concentrated on finding good chord templates to fit the chroma features. In this paper we reverse this approach and seek to find chroma features that are more suitable for usage in a musically-motivated model. We do so by performing a prior approximate transcription using an existing technique to solve non-negative least squares problems ({NNLS}). The resulting {NNLS} chroma features are tested by using them as an input to an existing state-of-the-art high-level model for chord transcription. We achieve very good results of 80\% accuracy using the song collection and metric of the 2009 {MIREX} Chord Detection tasks. This is a significant increase over the top result (74\%) in {MIREX} 2009. The nature of some chords makes their identification particularly susceptible to confusion between fundamental frequency and partials. We show that the recognition of these diffcult},

In pop and jazz music, a sequence of chord labels is often the only written record of a song, and forms the basis of so-called lead sheets. We devise a fully automatic method to simultaneously estimate from an audio waveform the chord sequence including bass notes, the metric positions of chords, and the key. The core of the method is a six-layered dynamic Bayesian network, in which the four hidden source layers jointly model metric position, key, chord, and bass pitch class, while the two observed layers model low-level audio features corresponding to bass and treble tonal content. Using 109 different chords our method provides substantially more harmonic detail than previous approaches while maintaining a high level of accuracy. We show that with 71\% correctly classified chords our method significantly exceeds the state of the art when tested against manually annotated ground truth transcriptions on the 176 audio tracks from the {MIREX} 2008 Chord Detection Task. We introduce a measure of segmentation quality and show that bass and meter modeling are especially beneficial for obtaining the correct level of granularity.},

The author’s ps13 algorithm and the pitch spelling algorithms of Cambouropoulos, Temperley and Longuet-Higgins were run on a corpus of tonal music containing 1.73 million notes. ps13 spelt significantly more of the notes in this corpus correctly than the other algorithms (99.33\% correct). However, Temperley’s algorithm spelt significantly more intervals between consecutive notes correctly than the other algorithms (99.45\% correct). All the algorithms performed less well on classical music than baroque music. However, ps13 performed more consistently across the various composers and styles than the other algorithms.},

	doi = {10.5075/epfl-thesis-9808},
	abstract = {Tonality has been the cornerstone of Western music-theoretical discourse for centuries. This study addresses the subject, using traditional music analysis, data-driven corpus methods, and computational models, concentrating on historical changes of tonality with a particular focus on the 19th century. The thesis engages three analytical levels of increasing scope - micro, meso, and macro - and is thus located between the poles of the particular and the general. The micro-level presents a detailed analysis of Franz Liszt's Sonetto 47 del Petrarca, S. 161, no. 4 (1858), in order to illustrate compositional innovations testifying to the radical changes in tonality within the 19th century. The analysis exemplifies how these novelties permeate musical compositions in that period, and also expose the benefits and limitations of manual music analysis. The meso-level examines a corpus of harmonic annotations of pieces by Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Liszt, Dvořák, Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and Medtner, containing over 75,000 chord symbols. It presents a comprehensive model for the analysis of chord symbols in large corpora in order to study chords and the progressions between them. Whilst the individual composers' chord vocabularies vary considerably - paying tribute to idiomatic usages of harmony - it is shown that the overarching similarities of the chord distributions point to similarities in their harmonic language that surpass individual traits and that can be modeled by Zipf's and Heaps's laws. An entropy-based method is presented to systematically study the effect of certain features on chord prediction, revealing that suspensions are the strongest predictors. The study shows that chord progressions are largely asymmetrical and proceed mostly by fifths; however, third-based progressions become increasingly prevalent within the studied period. The macro-level explores a corpus of nearly 3 million notes in more than 2000 pieces created by 75 composers, comprising a historical range of approximately 600 years. The encoding of the data distinguishes enharmonically equivalent notes, hence providing a larger note vocabulary than most previous approaches in empirical music research. A Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) shows that the line of fifths can be derived from the co-occurrence as well as the co-evolution of tonal pitch-classes. Moreover, the hierarchical topic model known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}) is used to discover latent tonal profiles. These largely correspond to distributions on contiguous line-of-fifths segments and moreover demonstrate the elevated roles of fifths as well as major and minor thirds as intervals between the most frequent notes. This motivates to model pieces as distributions on the Tonnetz. To that end, a new model, the Tonal Diffusion Model ({TDM}), is introduced. The results are obtained by fitting the model to the corpus and exhibit two trends. Over the entire historical period under consideration, notes are primarily distributed along the fifths axis of the Tonnetz. Furthermore, 19th-century composers also explore the major and minor thirds axes of the Tonnetz, extending their compositions in ever farther regions. The diverse methodology in this study provides quantitatively grounded insights from a range of perspectives, bridging the fields of music theory, computational musicology, mathematical modeling, and the digital humanities.},

We introduce a series of examples in which different encodings effectively modify the content of two---apparently equivalent---symbolic music files. These examples have been obtained from comparing three different encodings of a string quartet movement by Ludwig van Beethoven. We present two scenarios in which encoding discrepancies may be introduced. In the first scenario, they have been introduced during the encoding of the symbolic music file by either the music notation software or the human encoder. The discrepancies introduced in this scenario are typically difficult to notice because they are visually identical to an accurate encoding. In the second scenario, the discrepancies have been introduced during the translation of the original file into other symbolic formats. In this scenario, the discrepancies may be related to propagating errors in the original encoding or to an erroneous translation of certain attributes of the musical content. Finally, we discuss the possibility of using the examples provided here for the mitigation of some of these discrepancies in the future.},

	abstract = {Throughout the common-practice period (1650–1900), it is customary to find changes of musical key within a piece of music. In current music theory terminology, the concepts of modulation and tonicization are helpful to explain many of these changes of key. Conversely, in computational musicology and music information retrieval, the preferred way to denote changes of key are local key features, which are oftentimes predicted by computational models. Therefore, the three concepts, local keys, modulations, and tonicizations describe changes of key. What is, however, the relationship between the local keys, modulations, and tonicizations of the same musical fragment? In this paper, we contribute to this research question by 1) reviewing the current methods of local-key estimation, 2) providing a new dataset with annotated modulations and tonicizations, and 3) applying all the annotations (i.e., local keys, modulations, and tonicizations) in an experiment that connects the three concepts together. In our experiment, instead of assuming the music-theoretical meaning of the local keys predicted by an algorithm, we evaluate whether these coincide better with the modulation or tonicization annotations of the same musical fragment. Three existing models of symbolic local-key estimation, together with the annotated modulations and tonicizations of five music theory textbooks are considered during our evaluation. We provide the methodology of our experiment and our dataset (available at https://github.com/{DDMAL}/key\_modulation\_dataset) to motivate future research in the relationship between local keys, modulations, and tonicizations.},

However, owing to the complexity of music and the sometimes ambiguous harmonic structure of polyphonic music, chord annotations are inherently subjective, and as a result any derived accuracy estimates will be subjective as well. In this paper, we investigate the extent of the confounding effect of subjectivity in reference annotations. Our results show that this effect is important, and they affect different types of automatic chord estimation systems in different ways. Our results have implications for research on automatic chord estimation, but also on other fields that evaluate performance by comparing against human provided annotations that are confounded by subjectivity.},

We propose to address the problem of local key ﬁnding by investigating the possible combination and extension of different previous proposed global key estimation approaches. The speciﬁcity of our approach is that we introduce key dependency on the harmonic and the metric structures. In this work, we focus on the relationship between the chord progression and the local key progression in a piece of music. A contribution of our work is that we address the problem of ﬁnding a good analysis window length for local key estimation by introducing information related to the metric structure in our model. Key estimation is not performed on empirical-chosen segment length but on segments that are adapted to the analyzed piece and independent from the tempo. We evaluate and analyze our results on a new database composed of classical music pieces.},

The framework is formulated in terms of acoustic models for both keys and chords, and a prior model that contains musicological knowledge about chords and keys. The latter consists of a compound of four components: a duration and a change model for both keys and chords. This division allows us to modify each of the components separately and to choose the most appropriate sources of knowledge for each of them. Furthermore, this makes it easier to interpret their role and their relevance in the estimation procedure. We compared multiple configurations of our system, increasing in complexity. This has permitted us to explore the relation between keys and chords, and the importance of integrating prior musicological knowledge into an automatic estimation system. It was found that chord estimation scores mostly depend on the integration of durational knowledge, while key estimation also requires prior information about the broader context.},

Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of {HMMs} are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of {HMMs} that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A technique for harmonic analysis is presented that partitions a piece of music into contiguous regions and labels each with the key, mode, and functional chord, e.g. tonic, dominant, etc. The analysis is performed with a hidden Markov model and, as such, is automatically trainable from generic {MIDI} files and capable of finding the globally optimal harmonic labeling. Experiments are presented highlighting our current state of the art. An extension to a more complex probabilistic graphical model is outlined in which music is modeled as a collection of voices that evolve independently given the harmonic progression.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the {ISBI} challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and {DIC}) we won the {ISBI} cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent {GPU}.

	abstract = {This thesis, titled Fifhs and octaves prohibited in the modal- tonal era, presents a study of sequences of consecutive fifths and octaves throughout the history of western music, basically focusing on the period from early renaissance to the romanticism. During the modal-tonal period, the prohibition of sequences of fifths and octaves was a compositional detail which, imposed as a norm compulsory application, conditioned the sound of western music with independence of the different styles that have been happening throughout these centuries. For this reason, this compositional aspect can be studied as a detail of a compositional practice with a few common foundations cultivated during some four hundred years. However, although the composers were present this rule, all of them performed, occasionally, this type of intervallic successions. This thesis presents a research and classification of this type of successions or typologies circumscribed, therefore, in the era of prohibition and, at the same time, of its practical implementation, analyzing the musical reasons that determine its use. The classification made established 17 categories, each of which brings together the different typologies that have a certain characteristic in common. Based on the different procedures used by composers, a total of 78 consecutive fifths and octaves typologies have been defined. In order to understand the reasons for the realization of some of these typologies, has carried out a study of acoustic and psychoacoustic. Thus, from a scientific point of view, can be understood in a more objective manner the reason of his practice. A suitable large number of works has been analysed since the temporary period studied is very extensive. Thus, the amount of analyzed compositions implies a significant enough sample in order to justify the results. Although thesis includes 927 examples of 188 composers, this selection has been made of the carried out analysis of some 6.100 works corresponding to 343 composers. There has been a search for numerous treaties of harmony and counterpoint to complete the presentation of the different typologies, as well as the chapter that deals with the reason of the prohibition, including opinions of various theorists. References to over two hundred treaties found have been exposed in the bibliography as useful reference. This research includes two extensions. On the one hand, the study of the main aesthetic emerged from the second half of the nineteenth century, presenting examples of consecutive fifths of different aesthetic works, and analyzing new compositional resources that facilitate this practice. On the other hand, includes a study of the influences that traditional music has had on the employment of this type of intervallic successions.},

	abstract = {Music is an art form which is realized in time. This dissertation presents computational methods for examining the temporality of music at multiple time-scales so that both short-term surface features and deeper long-term structures can be studied and related to each other. The methods are applied in particular to musical key analysis (Chapters 2-4) and also adapted for use in performance analysis (Chapters 5-6). The essential methodology is to examine all sequential time-scales within a piece using some analytic process and then arrange a summary of the analytic results into a maximally overlapped arrangement. Chapter 2 defines a two-dimensional plotting domain for displaying musical features at all possible time-scales which forms a basis for further analysis methods. The resulting structures in the plots can be examined subjectively as a navigational aid in the music as illustrated in Chapters 3 and 5. They can also be used to extract musically relevant information as discussed in Chapters 4 and 6.},

This historical survey compactly summarizes relevant work, much of it from the previous millennium. Shallow and Deep Learners are distinguished by the depth of their credit assignment paths, which are chains of possibly learnable, causal links between actions and effects. I review deep supervised learning (also recapitulating the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning \& evolutionary computation, and indirect search for short programs encoding deep and large networks.},

	abstract = {In the first part of this paper, a regular recurrent neural network ({RNN}) is extended to a bidirectional recurrent neural network ({BRNN}). The {BRNN} can be trained without the limitation of using input information just up to a preset future frame. This is accomplished by training it simultaneously in positive and negative time direction. Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the {TIMIT} database show the same tendency. In the second part of this paper, it is shown how the proposed bidirectional structure can be easily modified to allow efficient estimation of the conditional posterior probability of complete symbol sequences without making any explicit assumption about the shape of the distribution. For this part, experiments on real data are reported.},

	abstract = {Motivated by evidence that image source statistics predict the response properties of several visual perception aspects, we provide an empirical analysis of the relation between chroma statistics and human judgments of tonality. To accomplish this, a statistical analysis method based on chroma feature covariance is proposed. It makes use of a large collection of western music to build a tonal profile. The obtained profile is compared to alternative tonal profiles proposed in the literature, either cognitively, perceptually, or theoretically inspired. The high degree of correlation we find between the covariance-based tonal profile proposed here and several ones proposed in the literature (reaching values higher than 0.9) is interpreted as evidence that human-derived profiles faithfully reflect the statistics of the musical input listeners have been exposed to. Furthermore, we show that very short time scales allow us to correctly predict these profiles, which brings us to discuss the role that local-scale implicit learning plays in building mental representations of tonality.},

	abstract = {We present a supervised neural network model for polyphonic piano music transcription. The architecture of the proposed model is analogous to speech recognition systems and comprises an acoustic model and a music language model. The acoustic model is a neural network used for estimating the probabilities of pitches in a frame of audio. The language model is a recurrent neural network that models the correlations between pitch combinations over time. The proposed model is general and can be used to transcribe polyphonic music without imposing any constraints on the polyphony. The acoustic and language model predictions are combined using a probabilistic graphical model. Inference over the output variables is performed using the beam search algorithm. We perform two sets of experiments. We investigate various neural network architectures for the acoustic models and also investigate the effect of combining acoustic and music language model predictions using the proposed architecture. We compare performance of the neural network-based acoustic models with two popular unsupervised acoustic models. Results show that convolutional neural network acoustic models yield the best performance across all evaluation metrics. We also observe improved performance with the application of the music language models. Finally, we present an efficient variant of beam search that improves performance and reduces run-times by an order of magnitude, making the model suitable for real-time applications.},

Input is in the form of {MIDI} files containing accurate pitch and rhythmic information with corresponding ground-truth spelling information for training and evaluation. The algorithm recovers harmonic information from the {MIDI} data and spells pitches according to their relation to the local tonic. The algorithm achieved 94.98\% accuracy on the pitches that required accidentals in the local key and 99.686\% overall. Voice-leading resolution was found to be the best feature of those used to infer the correct spelling. Also, this paper outlines great potential for improvement under this model.},

This is a project of psychological interest, because much evidence exists that harmonic analysis is performed by trained and untrained listeners during listening; however, the perspective of the current project is computational rather than psychological, simply examining what has to be done computationally to produce "correct" analyses for pieces. One of the major innovations of the project is that pitches and chords are both represented on a spatial representation known as the "line of fifths"; this is similar to the circle of fifths except that distinctions are made between different spellings of the same pitch class. The algorithm uses preference rules to evaluate different possible interpretations, selecting the interpretation that most satisfies the preference rules. The algorithm has been computationally implemented; examples of the program's output are given and discussed.},

{THIS} {STUDY} {EXAMINES} {THE} {DISTRIBUTIONAL} {VIEW} {OF} key-finding, which holds that listeners identify key by monitoring the distribution of pitch-classes in a piece and comparing this to an ideal distribution for each key. In our experiment, participants judged the key of melodies generated randomly from pitch-class distributions characteristic of tonal music. Slightly more than half of listeners' judgments matched the generating keys, on both the untimed and the timed conditions. While this performance is much better than chance, it also indicates that the distributional view is far from a complete explanation of human key identification. No difference was found between participants with regard to absolute pitch ability, either in the speed or accuracy of their key judgments. Several key-finding models were tested on the melodies to see which yielded the best match to participants' responses.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

A model of key finding is presented for single-voiced pieces of tonal music. Each tone is input as a pitch class and a duration. The model makes a parallel search for the key in the scalar and chordal domains, taking into account primacy and memory constraints. The model has been tested for a range of tonal music including the fugue subjects of J. S. Bach's Wohltemperierte Klavier ({WTK}). The notated key was usually found after a few processing steps and from then on remained stable— but was still sensitive to modulation. The performance of the parallel-processing model was compared with the performance of key-finding models previously proposed by Krumhansl and Schmuckler and by Longuet-Higgins and Steedman. The comparison showed that the new model's most distinctive features, implementation of parallel key search in the scalar and chordal domains, as well as the implementation of search-restricting factors, primacy and memory, make the new model a powerful and plausible alternative to the other models. Subsequently, the parallel-processing model's perceptual plausibility has been tested in two experiments, in which 20 musically well-trained subjects had to produce the key(s) of eight {WTK} fugue themes (Experiment 1) and to rate the key transparency for seven contrapuntal variations of the A minor subject of J. S. Bach's Kunst der Fuge (Experiment 2). A substantial concordance between listeners' judgments and the key inferences produced by the model was found in both experiments. Conceptual limitations, such as the model's disregard for the potential impact of recency on key finding and for expectations from functional implications of tone order, are discussed. Potential extensions of the model are suggested, as well as ideas for further perceptual studies in which the model might be tested in a more advanced manner than in the present study.},

	abstract = {Backpropagation is often viewed as a method for adapting artificial neural networks to classify patterns. Based on parts of the book by Rumelhart and colleagues, many authors equate backpropagation with the generalized delta rule applied to fully-connected feedforward networks. This paper will summarize a more general formulation of backpropagation, developed in 1974, which does more justice to the roots of the method in numerical analysis and statistics, and also does more justice to creative approaches expressed by neural modelers in the past year or two. It will discuss applications of backpropagation to forecasting over time (where errors have been halved by using methods other than least squares), to optimization, to sensitivity analysis, and to brain research. This paper will go on to derive a generalization of backpropagation to recurrent systems (which input their own output), such as hybrids of perceptron-style networks and Grossberg/Hopfield networks. Unlike the proposal of Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, this generalization does not require the storage of intermediate iterations to deal with continuous recurrence. This generalization was applied in 1981 to a model of natural gas markets, where it located sources of forecast uncertainty related to the use of least squares to estimate the model parameters in the first place.},

	abstract = {Basic backpropagation, which is a simple method now being widely used in areas like pattern recognition and fault diagnosis, is reviewed. The basic equations for backpropagation through time, and applications to areas like pattern recognition involving dynamic systems, systems identification, and control are discussed. Further extensions of this method, to deal with systems other than neural networks, systems involving simultaneous equations, or true recurrent networks, and other practical issues arising with the method are described. Pseudocode is provided to clarify the algorithms. The chain rule for ordered derivatives-the theorem which underlies backpropagation-is briefly discussed. The focus is on designing a simpler version of backpropagation which can be translated into computer code and applied directly by neutral network users.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {An echo state network ({ESN}) consists of a large, randomly connected neural network, the reservoir, which is driven by an input signal and projects to output units. During training, only the connections from the reservoir to these output units are learned. A key requisite for output-only training is the echo state property ({ESP}), which means that the effect of initial conditions should vanish as time passes. In this paper, we use analytical examples to show that a widely used criterion for the {ESP}, the spectral radius of the weight matrix being smaller than unity, is not sufficient to satisfy the echo state property. We obtain these examples by investigating local bifurcation properties of the standard {ESNs}. Moreover, we provide new sufficient conditions for the echo state property of standard sigmoid and leaky integrator {ESNs}. We furthermore suggest an improved technical definition of the echo state property, and discuss what practicians should (and should not) observe when they optimize their reservoirs for specific tasks.},
