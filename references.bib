	abstract = {The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory is the first comprehensive history of Western music theory to be published in the English language. A collaborative project by leading music theorists and historians, the volume traces the rich panorama of music-theoretical thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day. Recognizing the variety and complexity of music theory as an historical subject, the volume has been organized within a flexible framework. Some chapters are defined chronologically within a restricted historical domain, whilst others are defined conceptually and span longer historical periods. Together the thirty-one chapters present a synthetic overview of the fascinating and complex subject that is historical music theory. Richly enhanced with illustrations, graphics, examples and cross-citations as well as being thoroughly indexed and supplemented by comprehensive bibliographies of the most important primary and secondary literature, this book will be an invaluable resource for students and scholars alike.},

	abstract = {As a music-theoretical term, “tonality” was first used by Alexander Choron in 1810 to describe the arrangement of the dominant and subdominant above and below the tonic and thus to differentiate the harmonic organization of modern music (tonalité moderne) from that of earlier music (tonalité antique). One of the main conceptual categories in Western musical thought, tonality most often refers to the orientation of melodies and harmonies toward a referential (or tonic) pitch class. In the broadest possible sense, however, it refers to systematic arrangements of pitch phenomena and relations between them.UsageA number of musical and discursive factors have contributed to a veritable profusion of definitions for the term. To begin with, there has been considerable indecision about what musical domain the term covers: whether it applies to both Western and non-Western music, or whether, within Western musical traditions, the term can be restricted to the harmonic organization of music from the so-called common practice (1600–1910) or includes all music that evinces a basic difference between consonance and dissonance. There have also been some basic theoretical disagreements about whether its constituent musical elements are melodies or harmonies: however narrow the definition given to the term, the domain of tonal music is so enormous, diverse, and complex that one can choose almost any combination of musical phenomena and theoretical principles as the basis for discussion. In addition to these musical problems, enormous discursive difficulties have arisen from the conceptual languages used to describe tonal phenomena, theoretical vocabularies that vary dramatically according to the aesthetic and epistemological commitments of the writer.},

	abstract = {The more complex a natural entity is, and the more interrelated its components are, the harder it often is for us to comprehend how it could have evolved from completely independent constituent elements. Human vision, for instance, is so immensely complex, with numerous specialized parts both in the eye itself and in the way that the brain processes visual signals, that it is difficult to imagine how each component evolved both separately and in interaction with its affiliates before the final, highly integrated developmental stage existed. The same is true of complex cultural systems that have evolved over long periods of time, among which is harmonic tonality. Virtually every aspect of harmonic tonality (tertian harmonies as primary compositional structures, contrapuntal voice leading connecting those harmonies, the bass as a harmonic foundation, notions of root generation, harmonic motion directed toward cadential goals, the interaction of diatonic scales and chromaticism, and the interaction of harmony and counterpoint with rhythm and meter) arose before tonal harmonic syntax existed. Even though those components interact quite intricately in tonal music, each arose within different musical contexts, and each was explained autonomously by teachings having long, independent theoretical traditions.The individual who first recognized that all those components interacted to create a sense of tonality was the French theorist and composer Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683–1764). Although Rameau proposed some original ideas, a major part of his theorizing in the treatises he published between 1722 and 1761 consisted of reformulating and combining long-standing concepts into a single harmonic, directional perspective. Rameau is an instance of that relatively rare theorist who was a major composer as well. Because of this, as much as he pursued theoretical ideas for their own consistency, he generally remembered that the function of a theory of harmony was to explain music as he understood it compositionally. This chapter traces many of these concepts and their attendant pedagogical traditions as inherited by the early eighteenth century, and then considers Rameau’s brilliant accomplishment of consolidating them into a unified (if not completely stabilized) harmonic theory. Lastly, this chapter surveys the evolving legacy of this now-dominant heritage in the late eighteenth century and beyond.},

	abstract = {Today most scholars agree that Rameau was the founder of modern harmonic theory. As we have seen in the previous chapter, Rameau attempted to synthesize in his many writings a multiplicity of ideas – both old and new, speculative and practical – into a unified theory of tonal harmony grounded upon a single underlying principle, the corps sonore (see Chapter 24, pp. 759–71). If he did not succeed in creating a truly systematic and stable theory of harmony owing to his many differing and often contradictory theoretical arguments and intellectual borrowings, he nonetheless bequeathed to the nineteenth century a number of compelling and richly suggestive ideas that would inspire theorists in their own efforts.In this chapter, we will look at the evolution of harmonic theory in the nineteenth century. This is of course a vast and complex topic. Given the profound changes in harmonic language between 1800 and 1900 – a period covering the end of Viennese Classicism and closing with Schoenberg’s first tentative steps beyond the tonal system – it is not surprising that theorists expended extraordinary energy and efforts in their attempts to rationalize this shifting practice. As it is impossible here to describe all of these efforts in detail, we will limit our scope to the development of Austro-German harmonic theory, a tradition which arguably encompasses some of the most innovative and influential writings on this topic for the entire century. Within this tradition, three individual trajectories can be traced back by differing routes to Rameau’s own theory: scale-degree (Stufen) theory, fundamental-bass theory, and function theory.},

	abstract = {Long after his major writings on harmony, counterpoint and analysis began to appear, Heinrich Schenker (1868–1935) remains one of the most important and influential theorists in the history of Western music. His achievements have often been compared to those of eminent thinkers of his age working in other fields, e.g., his Viennese compatriots Sigmund Freud in psychology and Albert Einstein in physics. His influence, modest (though not negligible) in his own lifetime, has grown steadily since the middle of the last century and shows no signs of abating. Already a paradigmatic figure in North American universities by the 1970s, he has since exerted a powerful influence in British and, more recently, European academic circles. Indeed, the interest shown in his life’s work is, in some respects, comparable to that of some of the twentieth century’s leading composers, and in this respect his reputation as a theorist is unequaled.That which is called “Schenkerian theory” is a complex set of regulatory principles that were initially intended to explain the tonal music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; it is at the same time a synthesis of many traditions, embracing Fuxian counterpoint, the thorough-bass teaching of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and late nineteenth-century harmonic theory. It is at once a sophisticated explanation of tonality, but also an analytical system of immense empirical power. Schenker’s ideas and work touch on, or have implications for, virtually every topic addressed in this volume.This chapter includes a synopsis of Schenker’s life and works, an explanation of the rudiments of his theory, remarks on its historical background, and a survey of its reception both as a pedagogical tool and as a basis for further investigation of a wide range of music.},
